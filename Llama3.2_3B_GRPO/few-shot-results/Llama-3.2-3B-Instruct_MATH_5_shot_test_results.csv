\begin{align*}

|x|&>3 \text{ or } |x|&<-3

\end{align*}To turn this into two different inequalities, one with the absolute value quantity as normal and a positive resulting value, and one with the absolute value removed but the negative sign in front of it, we can remove the absolute value bars.  Then both have $x$ on the left.



\begin{align*}

x&>3\\

x&<-3

\end{align*}Next, we solve the inequality $|x+1|\le7$.  This means that we must consider two different cases: when $x+1$ is nonnegative and when it's negative.  When $x+1 \ge 0$, then the absolute value bars may be removed:



\begin{align*}

|x + 1|&\le 7\\

x + 1 & \le 7\\

x&\le6

\end{align*}Since we also know that $x+1$ is nonnegative, this means that $x \ge -1$.  Therefore, the solution to this case is $-1\le x\le 6$.  



Now consider the case when $x + 1 < 0.$  In order for the absolute value expression to be nonnegative, we need to multiply it by -1.  So the inequality becomes



\begin{align*}

-(x+1)&\le7\\

-x-1&\le7\\

-x&\le8\\

x&\ge-8.

\end{align*}Since $x + 1$ is negative in this case, we must also have that $x < -1.$  Therefore, the solution to this case is $[-8,-1).$



Now combine these cases: since both conditions for $|x|$ had a nonstrict inequality symbol on them (i.e. they could be equal), then the final answer will include all values of $x$ which satisfy each of the inequalities individually.  Since we want all integers that satisfy $[-8,-1)$ and $(-3,\infty) \cap [-1,6]$, we can find these by finding the intersection of the two intervals.



\begin{align*}

[-8,-1)&=(-8,-1)\\

(-3,\infty)\cap[-1,6]&=[-1,6]

\end{align*}Now intersecting the first interval with the second gives



\[

(-8,-1)\cap [-1,6] = (-8,-1).

$$\left(1+\dfrac{13}{4}\right)^5=4^{0+5\log_416+10 \cdot 2 \log_{16}(13)+(10)(9)\cdot3\log_{16}(13)+5 \cdot4\log_{16}13+\left(\left(4^1\right)\right)^5.$$We can write the expression as



$$4^{0+5\log_416+20\log_{16}(13)+(90)\log_{16}(13)+20\log_{16}13+(4)^5}.$$



Since $\dfrac{\log 16}{\log 13}$ is $2$, we can write the expression as



$$4^{0+5(1)(2)+(20)(2)+(90)(2)+(20)(2)+(4)^5}=4^{10+70+180+360+1024}.$$



We can simplify this as follows:



$$4^{1448}.$$Since $17^x = 4^{\frac{1}{5}\cdot x\log_41}$, we have



$$17^x=4^{\left(1448\right)\cdot \dfrac{1}{5}}.$$



Therefore,



$$(4+3)^{\left(1448\right)\cdot\dfrac{1}{5}}=4^{\left(1448\right)\cdot\dfrac{1}{5}}.$$We can simplify the expression as follows:



$$17^{288}=4^{289}.$$



Since $x = \log_{17} 4^{289}$, we have



$$\boxed{x=289\log_417}.$$"

We can calculate the slope by choosing any two points from the given table, such as $(2,-5)$ and $(p,-14)$. The formula for calculating the slope is $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.



## Step 2: Calculate the slope using the first two points $(2,-5)$ and $(p,-14)$.

The slope of the line can be calculated as follows:

$\frac{-14 - (-5)}{p - 2} = \frac{-9}{p - 2}$



## Step 3: Now, we use another point from the table to create a second equation involving $p$ and solve for it.

Using the points $(p,-14)$ and $(p+2,-17)$, we can write the slope formula again as $\frac{-17-(-14)}{(p+2)-p} = \frac{-3}{2}$.



## Step 4: Since both expressions represent the same line, their slopes must be equal.

Therefore, we have:

$\frac{-9}{p - 2} = \frac{-3}{2}$



## Step 5: Solve for $p$ by cross-multiplying and simplifying.

Solving this equation gives us:

$-9 * 2 = -3(p-2)$

$-18 = -3p +6$

$-24= -3p$

$p = \frac{-24}{-3}$



## Step 6: Simplify $p$ to a whole number.

$p=8$



## Step 7: Determine the value of $q$ by substituting the value of $p$ into one of the given equations for line.

We know that point $(13, q)$ lies on this same line. Therefore we can use any point and substitute to get q.



## Step 8: Solve for $q$.

Using $(2,-5)$

$q=\frac{-5-\left(\frac{-14-(-5)}{2}\right)(13-2)}{\left(\frac{-9}{p - 2}\right)(p+2)-1}$

Since we know that $\left(\frac{-14-(-5)}{2}\right)=\frac{-9}{p-2}$ and $p=8$, then 

$q=\frac{-5+\left(\frac{-9}{8-2}\right)(13-2)}{\left(\frac{-9}{6}\right)(10)-1}$

which we can further simplify to get the final value for q. $q = \frac{-5-\left(-\frac{3}{4}(11)\right)}{\left(-\frac{3}{2}(10)-1\right)}$



## Step 9: Solve for q.

Solving this equation gives us:

$q=\frac{-5+\frac{33}{4}}{\left(\frac{-30-2}{2}\right)}$

which we can further simplify to get the final value for q. $q = \frac{\frac{-20+33}{4}}{\left(-\frac{32}{2}\right)}$



## Step 10: Simplify q.

Solving this equation gives us:

$q=\frac{\frac{13}{4}}{\left(-16\right)}$

$q = -\frac{13}{64}$



## Step 11: Calculate $p + q$ by adding the values of $p$ and $q$ together.

We found that $p=8$ and $q=-\frac{13}{64}$. Adding these two values gives us:

$p+q=8-\frac{13}{64}$



## Step 12: Simplify the expression for $p + q$ to a decimal value rounded to the nearest tenth.

To do this, we convert $8$ into a fraction with a denominator of $64$, which is $\frac{512}{64}$. Then we can subtract:

$\frac{512}{64}-\frac{13}{64}$



## Step 13: Calculate $\frac{512}{64}-\frac{13}{64}$.

Combining these two fractions gives us:

$\frac{499}{64}$.

Now we can use this common ratio to find the eighth term. The sequence starts with $\dfrac{125}{9}$, and the first term is multiplied by $\dfrac{3}{5}$ to get the second term. Therefore, the second term is $\dfrac{125}{9}\cdot \dfrac{3}{5} = \dfrac{25}{3}$



The third term can be obtained by multiplying the second term by the common ratio:  $\dfrac{25}{3}\cdot \dfrac{3}{5}=\dfrac{15}{1}=15$ 



Now, to find the eighth term, we multiply the previous term (the seventh term) by the common ratio. The sixth and fifth terms are both $3$. Therefore, the fifth term multiplied by $\dfrac{3}{5}$ is equal to the sixth term: $3\cdot \dfrac{3}{5}=\dfrac{9}{5}$



The fourth term is obtained from the third term by multiplying by $\dfrac{3}{5}$ as well: 15$\cdot \dfrac{3}{5}=9$



We repeat this process until we find the eighth term. 



First, multiply $9$ by $\dfrac{3}{5}=\dfrac{27}{5}$.



Second, multiply $\dfrac{27}{5}$ by $\dfrac{3}{5}=\dfrac{81}{25}$.



Third, multiply $\dfrac{81}{25}$ by $\dfrac{3}{5}=\dfrac{243}{125}$

However, if $x<-3$, then $x^2>9$ so that $|x^2 + 4| > 13$. Similarly, if $x>1$, then $|x^2+4|>5$.



Thus, for this case, we must have $-3<x<1.$



Case 2: $x^2+4<0.$ However, since $x^2\ge 0$, the inequality is always false. Thus, there are no solutions in this case.

The revenue will be maximized if it sells as many books as possible while still earning a profit. Since the bookstore has unlimited funds, we need only consider how much profit it makes with different prices.



We see that when p = 32, the number of books sold is 128 - 4*32 = 0. Therefore, no matter what price we charge, if we charge more than $32, the store will not sell any books and the revenue will be zero.



Now let's examine other values for p between 0 and 32. For each value of p in this range, the number of books sold is a negative multiple of p. The more books that are sold, the higher the revenue; therefore, to maximize revenue, we want to find the largest possible number of books that can be sold.



To do so, let's assume we choose $p = k$.  We need only solve for k when the price (in dollars) is given as p. The equation we will use to solve this problem is given by $$128-4k=\text{number of books that are sold}$$ In order to maximize our revenue, we want to find the maximum value of $128 - 4k$, which is found when k = 32.



The price at which the number of books sold will be maximized will thus be $\boxed{\$32}$.



To prove this, let's examine another example. Suppose that instead of selling books for p dollars, we sell them for $\frac{p}{2}$ dollars. Then the number of books that are sold is given by $$128-2\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)$$



Simplifying gives $$128-p.$$



We see that this quantity will be maximized when $p=0$.



Now suppose we sell our book for $\frac{4p}{3}$ dollars. Then the number of books sold is given by:



$$128-\frac{4p}{3}$$

which again can be maximized by letting $p=0$. This example shows that no matter how much we adjust the price, if we charge more than $\$32$, we will not sell any books and our revenue will be zero.



We now know this value of p is the maximum possible; it remains to verify this. If we let $p = 32$, then the number of books sold is $$128 - 4\left(32\right)$$, which is equal to 0. This verifies that $p=32$ is the maximum possible.



We now know this value of p is the maximum possible; it remains to verify this. If we let $p = k$, then the number of books sold is $$128 - 4k,$$ and we want to maximize this quantity. Since this expression is a linear function, the maximum will be found at its vertex, which is given by the formula $$x=-\frac{b}{2a}.$$



The equation that we are maximizing can be written in the form $y=128-4k$, so our variables are y and k, and we have $a=-4$ and $b=128$.  Substituting these into the formula gives: \begin{align*}

x&=-\frac{b}{2a}\\

&=\frac{-128}{2(-4)}\\

&=\boxed{16}.

\end{align*}So $k = p = 16$ maximizes the quantity, and it is clear that this is greater than 32. Therefore, our answer of $\boxed{\$32}$ was correct.



Note that in general, if we are maximizing a linear function of the form $y=mx+b$, then the maximum will be found at its vertex, which has coordinates $(x,y)=\left(-\frac{b}{m}, f\left(-\frac{b}{m}\right)\right)$."

From the diagram we see that this occurs when $$\frac k{16}\le \frac k{n+1},$$ or $$n+1\ge 16.$$

Now consider a given value of $n$, and let $A_n=\left\{\frac k{n+1}\:\big| \: 1\le k\le n\right\}$. Then we have

\[\sum_{k=1}^{14}\frac{k}{16} = \left(\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor\sqrt{16}\rfloor}\frac k{2+\sqrt{16}}\right) + \left(14-\lfloor\sqrt{16}\rfloor\right)\cdot\frac14,\] and we can evaluate this expression to get $$\frac12+\frac13+\cdots+\frac1{8}+3\cdot\left(\frac14\right)=\frac{1^2}{2}+\frac{1^2+2^2}{3}+\frac{(1^2+2^2)+(3^2)}{4}+3\cdot\left(\frac{1^2+2^2+3^2}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{5}{6}+\frac{14}{12}+\frac{37}{16}=\boxed{\frac{237}{48}}.$$"

\left(3k-4\right)&=2n\\

5k+8&=7n.

\end{align*} Multiplying both sides by $7$ in the first equation gives us $21k -28 = 14n$, and multiplying both sides of the second equation by $7$ gives us $35k +56 = 49n$. Subtracting the former from the latter yields $14k+24=35n-14n \implies 14k = 21n$. Dividing this by $7$ on both sides gives $2k = 3n$, or equivalently, $\frac{k}{n}=\frac{3}{2}$.



We can also multiply the first equation by $5$ and the second equation by $3$: \begin{align*}

\left(15k-20\right)&=10n\\

15k+24&=21n.

\end{align*}  Subtracting the former from the latter gives us $44 = 11n$, or equivalently, $\frac{n}{1}=4$. We know that the original ratio of numbers was $3:5$; we also know that when $8$ is added to the larger number and $4$ is subtracted from the smaller number, the ratio becomes $2:7$. Therefore, in this case, let us use $\frac{n}{k} = \frac{5}{3}$ for the original numbers.  Since we now have both values of $n$ (namely $n=4$ and $n=\frac{15}{11}$), we can solve for $k$:



$$

\begin{aligned}

\frac{k}{n}&=\frac{3}{2}\\

\implies \quad k&=\frac{3}{2}n\\

\end{aligned}

$$



If we use the first equation to substitute for $n$, we have $\frac{n}{k}=\frac{5}{3}$, or equivalently,



$\frac{k}{4} = \frac{3}{2}\implies k=6.$  But this contradicts our equation $k=\frac{15}{11}$.  Therefore, the only solution to the original equations is when $\frac{n}{k}=\frac{5}{3}$.



Thus, let us use this ratio for the two numbers: $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{5}{3}$; where $a$ and $b$ are integers.  Then we know that



\begin{align*}

\left(3k-4\right)&=2n\\

5k+8&=7n.

\end{align*}



If we let $3k = 5m$, we have $k=\frac{5}{3}m$. Substituting into the first equation gives \begin{align*}

\left(5m-4\right)&=2n\\

10m+8&=14n.

\end{align*}



The second equation can be written as $\frac{10m + 8}{2} = 7n$. Therefore, $5m + 4 = 7n$. Multiplying the first equation by $7$ gives us $35m -28 = 14n$, or equivalently, $(35m+28) - (4(7n))=0$. This is equivalent to $5m+4-28=0 \implies 5m-24=0$, so we have $5m=24 \implies m=\frac{24}{5}.$



If we let $k=\frac{5}{3}m$, then we know that $k =\boxed{\frac{24}{5}}$.



However, the original problem said to find the larger of the two numbers.  We found that if we used $m=\frac{24}{5}$, the solution was $a=k=\frac{24}{5}$. Therefore, if we multiply this by $3$, the value for the larger number is $\boxed{\frac{72}{5}}$.

The first multiple of 3 in this range is 102, and the last one is 198.



Now, let's calculate how many multiples of 3 there are in this range:



The number of terms in an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: n = (L - F) / d + 1



where:

n = number of terms

L = last term (in this case, 198)

F = first term (in this case, 102)

d = common difference (in this case, 3)



Plugging in the values, we get:



n = (198 - 102) / 3 + 1

= 96 / 3 + 1

= 32 + 1

= 33



So, there are 33 multiples of 3 between 100 and 200.



Now that we have the number of terms, we can calculate the sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:



Sum = (n/2) * (F + L)



Plugging in the values, we get:



Sum = (33/2) * (102 + 198)

The powers of 2 appear to be missing: we start with $0 = 2^0$, then add $1 = 2^0+2^1$, then multiply by $1=2^0\cdot2^1$, and so on. So the pattern is that when a term in the sequence is produced by adding another integer, it must be a power of 2 (since we are adding an integer to the previous term). When a term in the sequence is produced by multiplying another integer, it must be a product of two integers (in other words, it can't be a prime number).



With this pattern, let's look at each term and write out its possible form:

Term 1: $0 = 2^0$

Term 2: $1 = 2^0+2^1$

Term 3: $1 \cdot 1 = 2^0\cdot2^1$

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $2c-2b=2$, so it follows that $c-b=1$. Therefore, $b+c=b+(b+1)=2b+1$.



We have that $\frac{a+2(b+1)}{2}=\frac{a+2b+2}{2}=7\Rightarrow a+2b+2=14$, so it follows that $a+2b=12$. Subtracting our earlier equation, we get that $12-2c = 12 \Rightarrow c=0$.



Since there are no restrictions on the value of $c$, and since we now know $c=0$, this means that the integers are equal to $7$ (from $a + 2b = 14$) and $0$. Therefore, the average of these two numbers is $\frac{7+0}{2}=\boxed{\frac{7}{2}}.$"

and



$$\left(\frac{a}{1-m/n}\right)^2 = \frac{(m/n)(m/n)}{1-(m/n)^2}=16(2000).$$Thus, we have

\begin{align*}

a^2 &= 32,000,000 (1 - m/n)^2 \\

&= 32,000,000 - 64,000,000(m/n) + 32,000,000(m^2/n^2)

Equating coefficients of both sides, we have

$$m^2/n^2 = 32,000,000,$$so $(mn)^2=32,000,000n^2$. Plugging $a=2000 (1-m/n)$ into our first equation yields

$$\frac{2,000(1 - m/n)}{1-m/n} = 2000.$$

Simplifying this gives us $2,000=(1)(2000) \Rightarrow 0 = 0$, which is true for all $m$ and $n$. Thus the common ratio of the original series must be $\frac{3}{4}$.



Since we are given that the two series have relatively prime positive integer ratios and since $mn=3/4\cdot 4=3$, we know that either $(m,n)=(1,3)$ or $(m,n)=(3,1)$. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{4}.$"

Since this is true, we can set up an equation: $$\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)\cdot 12 + \left(\frac{1}{15}\right)\cdot 3 = \frac{x}{10}$$ where $x$ represents the number of days that the supplies will last. Simplifying this yields $\left(\frac{6}{10}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{10}\right)=\frac{x}{10}$, and further simplification gives $\frac{8}{10}= \frac{x}{10}$.
