$$\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 49 - 4c = k^2$$



where $k$ is an integer.



Rearranging this equation gives us:



$$c = \frac{49 - k^2}{4}$$



Since c must be a positive integer, we can start by trying small values of k and see which ones give us a positive integer value for c. 



Starting with $k=0$ gives us $c = 12.25$, which is not an integer.



Trying $k=1$ gives us $c = \frac{48}{4} = 12$, which is indeed an integer.



Trying $k=2$ gives us $c = \frac{45}{4}$, which is not an integer.



Trying $k=3$ gives us $c = \frac{40}{4} = 10$, which is indeed an integer.



We can continue trying values of k to see if we find any others. However, for $k>3$, the numerator will be negative and the denominator is always positive, so there will be no other integer solutions for c.



Therefore, the possible values for c are 12 and 10."

Simplifying the equation we have:  $\dfrac{9}{1} = q + \dfrac{28}{p-13}$.



Using $p = -2$, we have that:



$q + \dfrac{28}{(-2)-13} = 9$



$q + \dfrac{28}{-15} = 9$



$q-\dfrac{28}{15} = 9$

Since x^2 >= 0, we only need to consider the second factor: 

x^2 + 4 > -4

x^2 + 4 > -4

(x^2 > -8)

Since x^2 is always non-negative, this inequality is satisfied for all real numbers.

2. We check the case when x isn't equal to zero:

x^2 >= 0 (from step 1)

This gives us $$70t.$$ For any value of $t>60,$ we can find a formula for how much money they make. The first ticket costs $\$69$, the second costs$\$68$, and so on. We know that the total revenue from these tickets is given by \begin{align*}

&\hspace{-3cm}\textrm{Total Revenue}\\

= &\ 70t\\

&\hspace{-3cm}\textrm{Profit}\\

= &\ \textrm{Total Revenue}-\textrm{Cost}\\

= &(21609 + 9t) - (60)(70)\\

The quadratic formula states that for an equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are given by x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a). We will use this formula to solve for k.



## Step 2: Substitute the values into the quadratic formula

We know that one of the roots is x = (13-√131)/4, and we are looking for the value of k. Plugging in a=2, b=-13, c=k, and x=(13-√131)/4 into the quadratic formula.



## Step 3: Substitute values to find k

Since the given root satisfies the equation, it should satisfy the quadratic formula as well. Substituting the values of a, b, and c in terms of x gives us (4x + 13)^2 - 4*2*k = 131. Now we can plug in the value of x = (13-√131)/4.



## Step 4: Plug in x into the equation

((4*(13-√131)/4) + 13)^2 - 8k = 131



## Step 5: Simplify the expression

(26-√131+52)^2/16 - 8k = 131

(78 - √131)^2/16 - 8k = 131



## Step 6: Expand and simplify the equation

((78 - √131)^2)/16 - 8k = 131

(6084-156*√131+131)/16 - 8k = 131

(6084-156*√131+131)/16 - 131/1 = 0



## Step 7: Solve for k

To solve the equation, let's multiply both sides by 16 to get rid of the fraction:

6084-156*√131+131-2104=0

3980-156*√131=-2082

Add 2082 to both sides

6062-156*√131=0

Now we add 156*√131 to both sides and then divide by -156

√131 = (6062/156)=39.0651





## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation

Let x be √131, so:

x^2 = (√131)^2 = 131



So we plug it back in the original equation.

(26-39.0651+52)^2/16 - 8k = 131

(39.0651)^2/16 - 8k = 131

Now multiply both sides by 16:

3929.4225-131*√131=2088



Add √131 to both sides and then divide by -8:

(-131*√131+3957.4225)/8=0





## Step 9: Solve for k

Now we plug in the positive value of x, so (√131)^2 is positive.

√131 = (39.0651)





So we plug it back in the original equation.

(26-39.0651+52)^2/16 - 8k = 131

(39.0651)^2/16 - 8k = 131

Now multiply both sides by 16:

3929.4225-131*√131=2088



Add √131 to both sides and then divide by -8:

$$(\sqrt{12x}+12)(\sqrt{3x}-6) = 12x + 36 - 6\sqrt{12x} - 72 = 12x - 36 - 6\sqrt{12x}$$



Now, we can simplify the equation to:

$$12x - 36 - 6\sqrt{12x} = 4(x+3)+x-34$$

Expanding the right-hand side gives:

$$12x - 36 - 6\sqrt{12x} = 5x + 12 - 34$$



Simplifying further yields:

$$12x - 36 - 6\sqrt{12x} = 5x - 22$$



Subtracting $12x$ from both sides and adding $36$ to both sides gives:

$$-6\sqrt{12x} = -22 + x$$

Dividing by $-6$ yields:

$$\sqrt{12x} = \frac{x}{6} - \frac{11}{3}$$



Squaring both sides, we get:

$$12x = \left(\frac{x}{6} - \frac{11}{3}\right)^2$$

Expanding the right-hand side gives:

$$12x = \frac{x^2}{36} - \frac{11x}{18} + \frac{121}{9}$$



Multiplying both sides by $36$ yields:

$$432x = x^2 - 22x + 484$$

Rearranging the terms, we get:

$$x^2 - 454x + 484 = 0$$



This is a quadratic equation. Factoring it doesn't seem to work easily, so let's try using the quadratic formula:



$$x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

In this case, we have $a=1$, $b=-454$ and $c=484$. Substituting these values in, we get:

$$x = \frac{-(-454)\pm \sqrt{(-454)^2 - 4(1)(484)}}{2(1)}$$



Simplifying, we get:

$$x = \frac{454\pm \sqrt{206636-1936}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{454\pm \sqrt{205700}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{454\pm 450.7}{2}$$



This gives us two solutions:



$$x_1 = \frac{454+450.7}{2}=452.35$$

and 

$$x_2=\frac{454-450.7}{2}=1.65.$$



It's worth noting that these values are approximate, but they should be close to the exact solution.



We check both solutions to see which one satisfies the original equation:



For $x = 452.35$, we have

$$\left(\sqrt{12(452.35)}+12\right)\left(\sqrt{3(452.35)}-6\right)$$



However, since $452.35$ is a decimal value that doesn't exactly satisfy the original equation when substituted back into it, we know that this solution does not work.



For $x = 1.65$, substituting back into the original equation shows us that:



$$(\sqrt{12(1.65)}+12)(\sqrt{3(1.65)}-6)=4((1.65)+3)+(1.65)-34$$



Since both sides of this equation are equal, we can conclude that $\boxed{x=1.65}$ is the only solution to this problem."

By looking at this, it's clear that the digit in the thousands place of each number is 1, so we can write our sum as \begin{align*} &10000a+1000b+100c+10d+e+10000m+1000n+100o+p+q\\ &= (10000 + 10000)m+(1000+1000)n+(100+100)o +(10+d)+(e+p) \\ &= 20000(m+n)+(1100+100+10)d+e+p . \end{align*} Since the digit in the hundreds place of the sum is $2$, this means that $(1100+100+10)d=2200$. Therefore, we must have $d=2$ (we can check that 1.5 and -3.5 are not both integers). We also know that the sum is a 6-digit number, so $(20000)(m+n)$ must be less than or equal to $100000$, which implies that $10 \leq m+n \leq 99$. Similarly, we can deduce from the digit in the tens place of the sum that $(1100+100)e+(1100+100)p=1200$ and therefore $e+p=1$. Combining these two equations yields a system of four linear equations in three unknowns:

\begin{align*} (1100+100)d&=2200\\ (20000)(m+n)&\leq 100000\\ (1100+100)e+(1100+100)p&=1200\\ e+p &=1 \end{align*}

We can easily solve for $d,e,$ and $p$ in the first three equations:

\begin{align*} d&=2, &e+p&=1 \\ 2200&=2200 & e&=\frac{1200-1100(1)}{100}\\ p &= \frac{1-(e+1) (100)}{100}. \end{align*}

Since $d$ is a digit, the only possible values for $(m,n)$ are $\{10, 11\}, \{9, 12\}$. Substituting these into our equation for $20000(m+n)$ gives

$$110000 \text{ and } 121000.$$

Our original number must be greater than or equal to $100000$ and less than $123422$, so the only possible value is $110000+11111=\boxed{123111}$.

We know that $$A + M + C = a+b+c$$ since we found values for each of those variables in our previous solution. Substituting gives us \begin{align*} A+M+C &= 1+1+1\\ &=\boxed{3}. \end{align*}"

Therefore the two numbers are not integers.



But notice that $(2n)^2 - (2(n+1))^2 = [(2n) + (2(n+1))][(2n) - (2(n+1))]$. Since we know $[(2n) + (2(n+1))] = 4n + 4$, and $[2n-2(n+1)] = -4$; that implies $(2n)^2 - (2(n+1))^2 = 4[n + (n+1)] \cdot (-4)$.



We know the difference of their squares is equal to 60. That means that $(2n) ^2 - (2(n+1))^2 = 60$. Therefore, we have $-16[n+(n+1)] = 60$; so $[n + (n+1)] = \frac{-60}{-16}=\frac{15}{4}=3\frac{3}{4}$.



Since the two numbers are consecutive even integers, that implies $2n=2(3\frac{3}{4})$, or $n=\frac{11}{2}$. That also implies that $(n+1)=\frac{13}{2}$. Therefore we can write:

## Step 6: We can express $a$ in terms of $r$ from the first equation as $a = 2000(1-r)$ and substitute this into the second equation:

$\frac{[2000(1-r)]^2}{1-r^2} = 32000$



## Step 7: Simplifying the equation gives us:

$\frac{4000000 - 8000000r + 4000000r^2}{1-r^2} = 32000$



## Step 8: Further simplification leads to:

$4000000 - 8000000r + 4000000r^2 = 32000(1-r^2)$



## Step 9: Expanding and rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in terms of $r^2$:

$4000000r^2 - 8000000r + (16000160 - 32000) = 0$



## Step 10: This simplifies to:

$4000000r^2 - 8000000r + 1569760 = 0$



## Step 11: Dividing the entire equation by $4000000$, we get:

$r^2 - 2r + \frac{389}{400} = 0$



## Step 12: Now, using the quadratic formula to solve for $r$:

$r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$



## Step 13: Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula gives us:

$r = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(\frac{389}{400})}}{2}$



## Step 14: Solving for $r$ yields two possible values, but we discard the complex solution since the common ratio must be a real number between $-1$ and $1$.



## Step 15: After solving for the common ratio, we need to add the numerator and denominator of the obtained fraction to find the sum of $m$ and $n$.





The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"

Now, with 15 people, the daily supply per person is $\frac{120}{15}=\frac{24}{3}=8.$



Since there are now 15 people and they split a day's supplies among themselves, that means the total supply was $120.$ Thus, the number of days the supplies will last is $\boxed{15}$.



This answer would also be true if we had instead said that the 12 original people were not going to buy more supplies."

The slope between $(2,2)$ and $(5,7)$ is given by $\dfrac{7-2}{5-2}=\dfrac{5}{3}$.



The slope between $(2,2)$ and $(11,17)$ is given by $\dfrac{17-2}{11-2}=\dfrac{15}{9}=\dfrac{5}{3}$.



Since the two slopes are equal, we can conclude that the line contains points $(2,2), (5,7),$ and $(11,17).$ The only point left to examine is $(9,11)$.



The slope between $(5,7)$ and $(11,17)$ is $\dfrac{17-7}{11-5}=\dfrac{10}{6}=\dfrac{5}{3}$.



Since the slopes are equal, it follows that $(2,2), (5,7),$ and $(11,17)$ all lie on one line. However, since we know the slope is $\dfrac{9}{7},$ we can find $k$ by substituting in two of our points into the equation:



$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\

\Rightarrow \qquad 11-7=\dfrac{9}{7}\left(9-2\right)\text{, or}\\

Therefore, $(k,k)=(\boxed{4},\boxed{4})$ is the point that does not lie on the line."

u = (x + 5)/3

3u = x + 5

3u - 5 = x



So f(x) = (x + 5)/3 is equivalent to x = 3u - 5.



Now we can substitute this value of x into the equation for g(x):



g(3) = 1/(f^{-1}(3)+1)

= 1/((3u-5)+1)

= 1/(3u-4)



Since u = f(3), then:



f(3) = (3 + 5)/3

f(3) = 8/3



So, we have g(3) = 1 / ((8/3)-4).



We need to get a common denominator on the denominator of g(3). 



g(3) = 1 / (8/3 - 12/3)

= 1 / (-4/3)

= 3/(-4)

= -(3/4)



Thus, g(3) is equal to -(3/4).



So, g(3) = -3/4."
