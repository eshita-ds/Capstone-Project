$$(x-7)(x+2)\leq 0$$

$$x = -2, x=7.$$



Since we have two distinct real roots, we know that the quadratic function is negative between them. To determine which interval satisfies this condition, let's pick a test point within each interval and see if it makes the expression positive or negative.



We can choose $-3$ as a test point within the interval $(-\infty,-2)$.

$$(x - 7)(x + 2) = (-3-7)(-3+2)=(-10)(-1)=10$$

To find the value of $r$, we can divide both sides by $1000$:

We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information:

We can now subtract the first of these equations from the second. We get $64x=68$, so dividing both sides by $64$ yields that $x=\frac{1}{2}$. Now, plugging this value for $x$ into our first equation gives us

Now that we have the common ratio, we can use it to find the eighth term. We know the first term is $\frac{125}{9}$ and the common ratio is $\frac{3}{5}$.



We can calculate the eighth term using the formula:

For this sequence, $a_1 = \frac{125}{9}$, $r = \frac{3}{5}$, and $n = 8$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:



$a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot (\frac{3}{5})^{8-1}$

$= \frac{125}{9} \cdot (\frac{3}{5})^7$

We are given that f is an invertible function from (-\infty,\infty) to (-\infty,\infty), and we need to find the value of f(x) - f^{-1}(x).

We are given that f(f(x)) = x. By definition, this implies that f(x) is equal to f^{-1}(f(x)). Since f is invertible, we know that f(x) = y if and only if f^{-1}(y) = x.



## Step 3: Substitute f(x) for y in the equation from step 2

Letting y = f(x), we have f(f(x)) = x. This means that f(x) is equal to the value of f inverse that gives us back x.

x^2 + 4x + 4 - x^2 = 60



Combine like terms to get:



4x + 4 = 60



Subtract 4 from both sides to get:



4x = 56



Divide by 4 to solve for x:



x = 14



So the smaller number is 14 and the larger number is 16. The sum of these two numbers is:

We are given that two positive numbers $p$ and $q$ have the property that their sum is equal to their product, i.e., $p + q = pq$, and their difference is $7$, i.e., $p - q = 7$. We need to find $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}}$ in the form $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$.



## Step 2: Express $p$ and $q$ using their difference

We can express $p$ as $q + 7$, since their difference is $7$.



## Step 3: Substitute $p$ into the equation $p + q = pq$

Substituting $p = q + 7$ into the equation, we get $(q + 7) + q = (q + 7)q$. This simplifies to $2q + 7 = q^2 + 7q$.



## Step 4: Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic

Rearranging the terms, we have $0 = q^2 + 5q - 7$.



## Step 5: Solve for $q$

Using the quadratic formula, $q = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Plugging in the values, we get $q = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 28}}{2}$.



## Step 6: Calculate the roots

Simplifying further, $q = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{53}}{2}$.



## Step 7: Choose the positive root for $q$

Since $q$ is a positive number, we choose the positive root: $q = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{53}}{2}$.



## Step 8: Find the corresponding value of $p$

Substituting this value back into the expression for $p$, we get $p = q + 7 = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{53}}{2} + 7$.



## Step 9: Simplify the expression for $p$

This simplifies to $p = \frac{\sqrt{53}-1}{2}$.



## Step 10: Calculate $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}}$

Now we can find $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}}$ by substituting the values of $p$ and $q$. After some algebra, this expression simplifies to $\frac{4 + \sqrt{53}}{53}$.



## Step 11: Find $a+b+c+d$

Finally, we can identify the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$: $a = 4$, $b = 1$, $c = 53$, and $d = 53$. Then, $a + b + c + d = 4 + 1 + 53 + 53$.



## Step 12: Calculate the final answer

Performing the arithmetic, we get $4 + 1 + 53 + 53 = 111$.





The final answer is: $\boxed{111}$"

1. The average of a and 2b is 7, so (a + 2b)/2 = 7, which implies that a + 2b = 14.

2. The average of a and 2c is 8, so (a + 2c)/2 = 8, which implies that a + 2c = 16.



Now, let's subtract the first equation from the second:



(a + 2c) - (a + 2b) = 16 - 14

2c - 2b = 2



Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:



c - b = 1 ... (3)



We can express c in terms of b using equation (3):



c = b + 1



Now, let's find the average of a, b, and c. We know that their sum is (a + b + c), and we want to find its value.



Since a + 2b = 14 and a + 2c = 16, we can set up an equation using these two equations:



(a + 2b) - (a + 2c) = 14 - 16

2b - 2c = -2



Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:



b - c = -1 ... (4)



Now, substitute c = b + 1 from equation (3) into equation (4):



b - (b + 1) = -1

-1 = -1



This is true! However, we can't find the individual values of a, b, and c using this method.



We need to realize that there are infinitely many possible values for a, b, and c that satisfy the given conditions. For example, if a = 5, b = 4, and c = 3, then:



(a + 2b)/2 = (5 + 8)/2 = 13/2 ≠ 7

So this is not a valid solution.



Another example: if a = 12, b = 6, and c = 5, then:



(a + 2b)/2 = (12 + 12)/2 = 24/2 = 12 ≠ 7

So this is also not a valid solution.



Similarly, we can check that the other values of a, b, and c do not satisfy the given conditions.



However, notice that for every value of b, there is exactly one corresponding value of a. For example, if b = 4, then:



a + 2b = 14

a + 8 = 14

a = 6



So we can express a in terms of b as follows: a = 14 - 2b.



Now, let's find the average of a, b, and c. We have:



average = (a + b + c)/3



Substitute a = 14 - 2b and c = b + 1 into this equation:



average = ((14 - 2b) + b + (b + 1))/3

= (15 + b)/3



Now, we need to find the value of b that satisfies the condition that (a + 2c)/2 = 8. Substituting c = b + 1 into this equation:



(a + 2(b + 1))/2 = 8

(a + 2b + 2)/2 = 8

a + 2b + 2 = 16



Substitute a = 14 - 2b into this equation:



(14 - 2b) + 2b + 2 = 16

14 + 2 = 16

This is true for any value of b, so we can't find a unique solution.



However, notice that if b = 3, then:



a = 14 - 6 = 8



So this is a valid solution. Then,



c = 4



and the average is:



average = (8 + 3 + 4)/3

Let's denote the cost of one day of camping trip as x. Since there were 12 people originally and they are going to have equal shares for each day, their share would be x/12 per person per day.



After three more people joined, the number of people becomes 15. So the new daily share will become x/15 per person per day.



Since they didn't make any further purchases, their supply is not changed. Therefore, we can divide the original total supply by (x/12) and also by (x/15). This gives us:



12/x * (x/12) = 10

and 

12/x * (x/15) = number of days



From the first equation, we know that there were 10 days worth of supplies originally.



We can now plug this value in the second equation:

(12/ x )*(x/15)= number of days 



So x cancels out and we are left with

12/15= number of days
