We can rewrite the denominator as $x^2+x-6 = (x+3)(x-2)$. So, the function becomes $y = \frac{2}{(x+3)(x-2)}$. Now, the function will be undefined when the denominator is zero, i.e., when $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$. This gives us $x+3 = 0$ or $x-2 = 0$, which leads to $x = -3$ or $x = 2$. These are the values of x for which the function becomes undefined. Now, we need to check if these values of x are also zeros of the numerator. In this case, the numerator is a constant, so it does not have any zeros. Therefore, $x = -3$ and $x = 2$ are the values of x for which the function becomes undefined, and hence, the function has vertical asymptotes at these points. To confirm this, we can check the sign of the function in the intervals $(-\infty, -3)$, $(-3, 2)$, and $(2, \infty)$. For $x < -3$, both $(x+3)$ and $(x-2)$ are negative, so the function becomes positive. For $-3 < x < 2$, $(x+3)$ becomes positive and $(x-2)$ becomes negative, so the function becomes negative. For $x > 2$, both $(x+3)$ and $(x-2)$ are positive, so the function becomes positive. Therefore, the function changes sign at $x = -3$, which confirms that there is a vertical asymptote at $x = -3$. Similarly, the function changes sign at $x = 2$, which confirms that there is a vertical asymptote at $x = 2$. Hence, the graph of the function has 2 vertical asymptotes. </think><answer> 2</answer>"

To calculate 120% of 30, we can multiply 30 by 1.2. So, 120% of 30 is equal to 30 * 1.2 = 36. Next, to calculate 130% of 20, we can multiply 20 by 1.3. So, 130% of 20 is equal to 20 * 1.3 = 26. Now, we need to find the positive difference between these two values. The positive difference between 36 and 26 is 36 - 26 = 10. </think><answer> 10</answer>"

We know that $\lceil x \rceil$ represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$, also known as the ceiling function. This implies that $\lceil x \rceil - x$ will always be less than or equal to $0$. We can use this information to create an inequality to solve for $x$. Let's rewrite the equation as $\lceil x \rceil = \dfrac{23}{7} - x$. Since $\lceil x \rceil$ is an integer, we know that $\dfrac{23}{7} - x$ must also be an integer. Therefore, we can write $\dfrac{23}{7} - x = n$, where $n$ is an integer. Substituting this back into the original equation, we get $\lceil x \rceil = n$. Since $\lceil x \rceil = n$, we know that $n - x$ must be less than or equal to $0$. This gives us the inequality $n - x \leq 0$, which simplifies to $x \geq n$. Substituting $\dfrac{23}{7} - x$ for $n$, we get $x \geq \dfrac{23}{7} - x$. Adding $x$ to both sides gives us $2x \geq \dfrac{23}{7}$. Dividing both sides by $2$ gives us $x \geq \dfrac{23}{14}$. Since $x$ must be greater than or equal to $\dfrac{23}{14}$, we can try to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the original equation. Let's try $x = \dfrac{23}{14}$. Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\lceil \dfrac{23}{14} \rceil + \dfrac{23}{14} = \dfrac{23}{7} + \dfrac{23}{14}$. Simplifying this expression gives us $\dfrac{23}{7} + \dfrac{23}{14} = \dfrac{46}{14} + \dfrac{23}{14} = \dfrac{69}{14}$. Since $\dfrac{69}{14}$ is not equal to $\dfrac{23}{7}$, $x = \dfrac{23}{14}$ is not the correct solution. We can try other values of $x$ that are greater than or equal to $\dfrac{23}{14}$. Let's try $x = \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\lceil \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{1}{2} \rceil + \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{23}{7} + \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{1}{2}$. Simplifying this expression gives us $\dfrac{23}{7} + \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{46}{14} + \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{7}{14} = \dfrac{76}{14}$. Since $\dfrac{76}{14}$ is still not equal to $\dfrac{23}{7}$, $x = \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{1}{2}$ is not the correct solution. We can continue trying values of $x$ until we find the correct solution. After some trial and error, we find that $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{2}$ is not the solution and $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7}$ is also not the solution. We try $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\lceil \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} \rceil + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Simplifying this expression gives us $\dfrac{23}{7} + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{46}{14} + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{2}{14} + \dfrac{7}{14} = \dfrac{74}{14}$. Since $\dfrac{74}{14}$ is still not equal to $\dfrac{23}{7}$, $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2}$ is not the correct solution. We can try $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7}$. Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\lceil \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7} \rceil + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7} = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Simplifying this expression gives us $\dfrac{23}{7} + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{2}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{46}{14} + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{4}{14} + \dfrac{7}{14} = \dfrac{72}{14}$. Since $\dfrac{72}{14}$ is still not equal to $\dfrac{23}{7}$, $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7}$ is not the correct solution. We can try $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7} - \dfrac{1}{7}$. Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\lceil \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7} - \dfrac{1}{7} \rceil + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7} - \dfrac{1}{7} = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Simplifying this expression gives us $\dfrac{23}{7} + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{3}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{46}{14} + \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{6}{14} + \dfrac{7}{14} = \dfrac{70}{14}$. Since $\dfrac{70}{14}$ is equal to $\dfrac{23}{7}$, $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{7} - \dfrac{1}{7}$ is the correct solution. However, we can simplify this expression further. Since $\dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{7}{14}$, we can rewrite $x$ as $x = \dfrac{23}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{7}{14} - \dfrac{1}{7}$. Combining like terms, we get $x = \dfrac{23}{14} + \dfrac{7}{14} - \dfrac{2}{7}$. Simplifying further, we get $x = \dfrac{30}{14} - \dfrac{2}{7}$. Since $\dfrac{2}{7} = \dfrac{4}{14}$, we can rewrite $x$ as $x = \dfrac{30}{14} - \dfrac{4}{14}$. Combining like terms, we get $x = \dfrac{26}{14}$. Finally, we can simplify this expression by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$. This gives us $x = \dfrac{13}{7}$. Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the original equation is $x = \dfrac{13}{7}$. </think><answer> $\boxed{\dfrac{13}{7}}$</answer>"

Since 25 is divisible by 4, the remainder is 0, and i^25 = 1. Therefore, i^-25 = 1. For i^45, the remainder is 1, so i^45 = i.

We can do this by subtracting any term from the previous term. In this case, let's subtract the second term from the first term: d = 10 - 6 = 4. Now that we know the common difference, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: an = a1 + (n - 1)d, where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference. In this case, a1 = 6 and d = 4. We want to find the 100th term, so n = 100. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: a100 = 6 + (100 - 1) * 4 = 6 + 99 * 4 = 6 + 396 = 402.

We start with the given inequality $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$. To solve this inequality, we first need to move all terms to the left-hand side by subtracting 10 from both sides, which gives us $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. Now, we need to factorize the quadratic expression on the left-hand side. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. These numbers are -7 and 2, so we can factorize the expression as $(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Now, we have factored the quadratic expression. To solve the inequality, we need to find the values of x that make the expression $(x - 7)(x + 2)$ less than or equal to zero. This happens when one of the factors is negative and the other factor is positive, or when both factors are zero. So, we need to find the intervals where $(x - 7) \le 0$ and $(x + 2) \ge 0$, or where $(x - 7) \ge 0$ and $(x + 2) \le 0. The first case gives us $x \le 7$ and $x \ge -2$, which can be combined to give $-2 \le x \le 7$. The second case gives us $x \ge 7$ and $x \le -2$, which is not possible since x cannot be both greater than or equal to 7 and less than or equal to -2 at the same time. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $-2 \le x \le 7$.</think><answer> $[-2, 7]$</answer>"

We know that Mr. Madoff invests $1000 in a fund that compounds annually at a constant interest rate. After three years, his investment has grown to $1225. Let's denote the annual interest rate as 'r'. We need to find the value of 'r' in percentage. We know that the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount (initial investment), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years. In this case, P = $1000, A = $1225, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 3 years. We can now plug these values into the formula and solve for 'r'. First, we can rearrange the formula to isolate the term (1 + r)^t. We get (1 + r)^t = A/P. Then we get (1 + r)^3 = 1225/1000. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get (1 + r) = ∛(1225/1000). Now, we solve for 'r' by subtracting 1 from both sides: r = ∛(1225/1000) - 1. Now we calculate r. r = ∛(1225/1000) - 1 = ∛(1.225) - 1 = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1. To convert 'r' to a percentage, we multiply by 100: r = 0.1 * 100 = 10. So, the annual interest rate is 10%. </think><answer> The annual interest rate is 10%. </answer>"

This means we can write the following equations: $a+b=10$, $a+c=18$, $a+d=19$, $b+c=20$, $b+d=21$, and $c+d=29$. Our goal is to find the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ in increasing order. We can solve these equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. By subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $c-a=8$. By subtracting the first equation from the third equation, we get $d-a=9$. We now have a system of two equations: $c-a=8$ and $d-a=9$. Solving for $c$ and $d$, we get $c=a+8$ and $d=a+9$. Now we can substitute $c=a+8$ and $d=a+9$ into the other equations. Substituting $c=a+8$ into the equation $b+c=20$, we get $b+(a+8)=20$, which simplifies to $b+a=12$. Since we know that $a+b=10$, we can solve for $b$ by subtracting $a$ from both sides of the equation. This gives us $b=10-a$. Substituting $b=10-a$ into the equation $b+a=12$, we get $(10-a)+a=12$, which simplifies to $10=12$. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that $b=10-a$ must be incorrect. Let's try another approach. By subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $c-a=8$. By subtracting the first equation from the third equation, we get $d-a=9$. We now have a system of two equations: $c-a=8$ and $d-a=9$. Solving for $c$ and $d$, we get $c=a+8$ and $d=a+9$. Now we can substitute $c=a+8$ and $d=a+9$ into the other equations. Substituting $c=a+8$ into the equation $b+c=20$, we get $b+(a+8)=20$, which simplifies to $b+a=12$. Since we know that $a+b=10$, we can solve for $b$ by subtracting $a$ from both sides of the equation. This gives us $b=10-a$. Substituting $b=10-a$ into the equation $b+a=12$, we get $(10-a)+a=12$, which simplifies to $10=12$. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that $b=10-a$ must be incorrect. Now let's solve the equation $a+d=19$. We can rewrite this equation as $a+(a+9)=19$, which simplifies to $2a+9=19$. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get $2a=10$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $a=5$. Now that we know the value of $a$, we can substitute it into the equation $a+b=10$. This gives us $5+b=10$, which simplifies to $b=5$. Now that we know the values of $a$ and $b$, we can substitute them into the equation $c+d=29$. This gives us $c+(5+9)=29$, which simplifies to $c=15$. Now that we know the values of $c$, we can substitute them into the equation $c-a=8$. This gives us $15-5=8$, which simplifies to $10=8$. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that $c=15$ must be incorrect. Let's try another approach. We can solve the equation $a+b=10$ for $b$, which gives us $b=10-a$. We can substitute this expression for $b$ into the equation $b+c=20$. This gives us $(10-a)+c=20$, which simplifies to $c=10-a$. We can substitute this expression for $c$ into the equation $c-a=8$. This gives us $(10-a)-a=8$, which simplifies to $10-2a=8$. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get $-2a=-2$. Dividing both sides by -2, we get $a=1$. Now that we know the value of $a$, we can substitute it into the equation $a+b=10$. This gives us $1+b=10$, which simplifies to $b=9$. Now that we know the values of $a$ and $b$, we can substitute them into the equation $b+d=21$. This gives us $9+(d)=21$, which simplifies to $d=12$. Now that we know the values of $c$, we can substitute them into the equation $c+d=29$. This gives us $c+(12)=29$, which simplifies to $c=17$.

To solve this equation, we need to consider the cases when the expressions inside the absolute value signs are positive and negative. We'll start by assuming that $5x - 1$ and $3x + 2$ are both non-negative, which gives us the equation $5x - 1 = 3x + 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $2x = 3$, which yields $x = \frac{3}{2}$. Now, let's assume that $5x - 1$ is non-negative and $3x + 2$ is negative, giving us the equation $5x - 1 = -(3x + 2)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $5x - 1 = -3x - 2$, which yields $8x = -1$, and $x = -\frac{1}{8}$. We should also consider the case when $5x - 1$ is negative and $3x + 2$ is non-negative, which gives us the equation $-(5x - 1) = 3x + 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $-5x + 1 = 3x + 2$, which yields $-8x = 1$, and $x = -\frac{1}{8}$. Lastly, let's assume that $5x - 1$ is negative and $3x + 2$ is negative, giving us the equation $-(5x - 1) = -(3x + 2)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $-5x + 1 = -3x - 2$, which yields $-2x = -3$, and $x = \frac{3}{2}$. Now, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation. Plugging in $x = \frac{3}{2}$ into the original equation, we get $|5(\frac{3}{2}) - 1| = |3(\frac{3}{2}) + 2|$, which simplifies to $|7| = |9|$. Since $7 \neq 9$, $x = \frac{3}{2}$ is not a valid solution. On the other hand, plugging in $x = -\frac{1}{8}$ into the original equation, we get $|5(-\frac{1}{8}) - 1| = |3(-\frac{1}{8}) + 2|$, which simplifies to $|-\frac{5}{8} - 1| = |-\frac{3}{8} + 2|$, and further simplifies to $|-\frac{13}{8}| = |-\frac{13}{8}|$. Since $|-\frac{13}{8}| = |-\frac{13}{8}|$, $x = -\frac{1}{8}$ is a valid solution.

The first condition is $|x| + 1 > 7$. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get $|x| > 6$. This implies that either $x > 6$ or $x < -6$. The second condition is $|x+1| \le 7$. This means that $-7 \le x+1 \le 7$. Subtracting 1 from all parts, we get $-8 \le x \le 6$. Now, we need to find the intersection of these two conditions.

This gives us $2A\sqrt{B} = 9C\sqrt{3}$. Next, we want to isolate the square root terms, so we square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square roots. This gives us $(2A\sqrt{B})^2 = (9C\sqrt{3})^2$, which simplifies to $4A^2B = 81C^2 \cdot 3$. Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation to get $4A^2B = 243C^2$. We can then divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get $A^2B = \frac{243}{4}C^2$. Now, we know that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, so $A^2$ and $C^2$ must be relatively prime. This means that $\frac{243}{4}$ must be a perfect square. Since 243 is 3 raised to the power of 5 and 4 is 2 raised to the power of 2, $\frac{243}{4}$ is equal to $\frac{3^5}{2^2}$, which is not a perfect square. However, $\frac{243}{4}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{3^5}{2^2} = \left(\frac{3^2}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}$. This implies that we must have $\left(\frac{3^2}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot C^2 = A^2B$. Now, since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we can deduce that $B$ must be equal to $\frac{3}{2}$. Now that we know the value of B, we can substitute this value back into our equation $A^2B = \left(\frac{3^2}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot C^2$ and simplify. This gives us $A^2\cdot \frac{3}{2} = \left(\frac{3^2}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot C^2$, which simplifies to $A^2 = 3^2 \cdot C^2$. Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, we can conclude that $A = 3C$. Now that we know the value of A in terms of C, we can substitute this value back into our original equation $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$. This gives us $\frac{3C\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, which simplifies to $3\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$. Now, we can cross-multiply and simplify to get $6\sqrt{3} = 9$, which is not true. This implies that our initial assumption that $B = \frac{3}{2}$ must be incorrect. We must have $B = 3$, since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1. Now that we know the value of B, we can substitute this value back into our equation $A^2B = \left(\frac{3^2}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot C^2$. This gives us $A^2 \cdot 3 = \left(\frac{3^2}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot C^2$, which simplifies to $A^2 = \frac{3^3}{2^2} \cdot C^2$. Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, we can conclude that $A = \frac{3^2}{2}C$, or $A = \frac{9}{2}C$. Now that we know the value of A in terms of C, we can substitute this value back into our original equation $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$. This gives us $\frac{\frac{9}{2}C\sqrt{3}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9}{2}\sqrt{3} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$. Now, we can cross-multiply and simplify to get $9\sqrt{3} = 9$, which is not true. This implies that our initial assumption that $A = \frac{9}{2}C$ must be incorrect.

Using Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is given by -b/a and the product of the roots is given by c/a. Here, a = 1, b = b, and c = 48. So, the sum of the roots is -b and the product of the roots is 48. Now, we can write the equation as 3x + x = -b and 3x * x = 48. Simplifying the first equation gives us 4x = -b, and solving for b gives us b = -4x. The second equation can be written as 3x^2 = 48, and solving for x^2 gives us x^2 = 16. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = ±4. Substituting x = 4 into b = -4x, we get b = -4 * 4 = -16. Substituting x = -4 into b = -4x, we get b = -4 * -4 = 16. So, the largest possible value of b is 16. </think><answer> 16</answer>"

We are given two equations based on the problem statement. The first equation represents the cost of eight pounds of feathers and two ounces of gold, which is $\$932$. This can be written as $8x + 2y = 932$. The second equation represents the cost of fourteen pounds of feathers and three ounces of gold, which is $\$1402$. This can be written as $14x + 3y = 1402$. We now have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values of $x$ and $y$. To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use the elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $-3$ and the second equation by $2$, we can eliminate the $y$-term. The first equation becomes $-24x - 6y = -2796$, and the second equation becomes $28x + 6y = 2804$. Adding both equations, we get $4x = 8$, so $x = 2$. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of $y$. Using the first equation, we get $8(2) + 2y = 932$, which simplifies to $16 + 2y = 932$. Subtracting $16$ from both sides, we get $2y = 916$, so $y = 458$. Now that we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can find the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold. The cost is $5x + 5y = 5(2) + 5(458) = 10 + 2290 = 2300$. Therefore, the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold is $\$2300$. </think><answer> $\boxed{\$2300}$</answer>"

The equation can be rewritten as $(x^2 + 8x) + (y^2 - 6y) = 0$. To complete the square for the $x$ terms, we add $\left( \frac{8}{2} \right)^2 = 16$ to both sides of the equation. Similarly, to complete the square for the $y$ terms, we add $\left( \frac{-6}{2} \right)^2 = 9$ to both sides. This gives us $(x^2 + 8x + 16) + (y^2 - 6y + 9) = 16 + 9$, which simplifies to $(x+4)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 25$. Now that we have the equation in standard form, we can easily identify the radius of the circle. The standard form of the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.

The sum of the elements of each subset can be calculated by simply adding the elements. For example, the sum of $\{1,2\}$ is $1+2=3$. We can do this for all 15 subsets. Alternatively, we can observe that each element $i$ of the original set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ appears in exactly $5$ subsets, since there are ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ subsets and each subset has two elements. Thus, the sum of all the elements is $5(1+2+3+4+5+6)$. This sum can be simplified to $5(21)=105$. Therefore, the sum of the 15 sums is $105 \cdot 5 = 525$. </think><answer> 525</answer>"

We can use the points $(2, -5)$ and $(p, -14)$ for this purpose. The slope of a line is given by $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. Therefore, the slope is $\frac{-14-(-5)}{p-2} = \frac{-9}{p-2}$. Next, we need to find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can use the point $(p, -14)$ and the slope we found earlier to write the equation as $-14 = \frac{-9}{p-2} \cdot p + b$. Now, we can use the point $(2, -5)$ to find the value of $b$. Substituting $x=2$ and $y=-5$ into the equation, we get $-5 = \frac{-9}{2-2} \cdot 2 + b$, which simplifies to $-5 = b$. Now we have the equation of the line: $y = \frac{-9}{p-2}x - 5$. We are given that the point $(13, q)$ lies on the line, so we can substitute $x=13$ and $y=q$ into the equation to solve for $q$: $q = \frac{-9}{p-2} \cdot 13 - 5$. To find the value of $p$, we can use the point $(p, -14)$ and the equation of the line: $-14 = \frac{-9}{p-2} \cdot p - 5$. Solving for $p$, we get $-14 + 5 = \frac{-9}{p-2} \cdot p$, which simplifies to $-9 = \frac{-9p}{p-2}$. Multiplying both sides by $(p-2)$, we get $-9(p-2) = -9p$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $-9p + 18 = -9p$, which simplifies to $18 = 0$. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-examine our previous steps. Upon re-examining our previous steps, we realize that we made an incorrect assumption. Let's re-evaluate the equation of the line. We can use the points $(p, -14)$ and $(p+2, -17)$ to write the equation as $-17 = \frac{-9}{p+2-p} \cdot (p+2) - 5$, which simplifies to $-17 = -5$. This is also a contradiction. We realize that we made another incorrect assumption. Let's re-evaluate the equation of the line again. We can use the points $(2, -5)$ and $(p, -14)$ to write the equation as $-14 = \frac{-9}{p-2} \cdot p - 5$, which simplifies to $-14 + 5 = \frac{-9p}{p-2}$. Solving for $p$, we get $-9 = \frac{-9p}{p-2}$. Multiplying both sides by $(p-2)$, we get $-9(p-2) = -9p$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $-9p + 18 = -9p$, which simplifies to $18 = 0$. This is still a contradiction. We realize that we made another incorrect assumption. Let's re-evaluate the equation of the line again. We can use the points $(2, -5)$ and $(p+2, -17)$ to write the equation as $-17 = \frac{-9}{p+2-2} \cdot (p+2) - 5$, which simplifies to $-17 = -5$. This is also a contradiction.

We can use the points $(2, -5)$ and $(p+2, -17)$ to write the equation as $-17 = \frac{-9}{p+2-2} \cdot (p+2) - 5$, which simplifies to $-17 = \frac{-9(p+2)}{p} - 5$. Solving for $p$, we get $-17 + 5 = \frac{-9(p+2)}{p}$. Multiplying both sides by $p$, we get $-12p = -9(p+2)$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $-12p = -9p - 18$. Adding $9p$ to both sides, we get $-3p = -18$. Dividing both sides by $-3$, we get $p = 6. Therefore, we can substitute $p=6$ into the equation of the line to solve for $q$: $q = \frac{-9}{6-2} \cdot 13 - 5$. Simplifying, we get $q = \frac{-9}{4} \cdot 13 - 5$. Multiplying, we get $q = \frac{-117}{4} - 5$. Converting $5$ to a fraction with a denominator of $4$, we get $q = \frac{-117}{4} - \frac{20}{4}$. Combining the fractions, we get $q = \frac{-137}{4}$.

Now that we have the common ratio, we can use it to find the eighth term of the sequence.

So, the equation becomes $(3^2)^{18n} = 3^{72}$. Using the power of a power rule again, we get $3^{36n} = 3^{72}$. Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents.

We can break this down into two separate inequalities: $-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}$ and $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$. Let's solve the first inequality. We can rewrite it as $x^{4}+4x^{2}+4>0$. This can be factored as $(x^{2}+2)^{2}>0$. Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, $(x^{2}+2)^{2}$ will always be greater than 0. Therefore, the first inequality is true for all real values of $x$. Now, let's solve the second inequality. We can rewrite it as $x^{4}+4x^{2}-21<0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^{2}$. Let's substitute $y=x^{2}$ to simplify the inequality. Now, we have $y^{2}+4y-21<0$. We can factor this as $(y-3)(y+7)<0$. Now, we can solve for $y$ by finding the intervals where the inequality is true. We have two critical points at $y=3$ and $y=-7$. Since $y=x^{2}$, we know that $x^{2}$ cannot be negative. Therefore, the interval where the inequality is true is $-7<y<3$. Now, we can substitute back $y=x^{2}$ to get $-7<x^{2}<3$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\sqrt{-7}<|x|<\sqrt{3}$. Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we can ignore the negative square root. Therefore, we have $0<|x|<\sqrt{3}$.

To add the terms together, we need to find a common denominator, which is $\sqrt{3}$. So, we can rewrite the expression as $\sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Multiplying the fractions on the left side, we get $\frac{7}{6w} = \frac{42}{3}$. Now, we can cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. This gives us $7 \times 3 = 42 \times 6w$. Simplifying, we get $21 = 252w$. Now, we can solve for $w$ by dividing both sides by $252$. This gives us $w = \frac{21}{252}$. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 21. This gives us $w = \frac{1}{12}$. So, the value of $w$ is $\frac{1}{12}$.</think><answer> $\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}$</answer>"

The common difference can be calculated as the difference between any two consecutive terms. In this case, we can calculate it as $987-1000=-13$. So, the common difference is $-13$. Now, to find the least positive integer in the sequence, we need to find the term that is closest to $0$. Since the common difference is negative, the terms in the sequence decrease as we move further away from $1000$. Therefore, to find the least positive integer, we can add the common difference to the first term until we get a positive integer. Adding $-13$ to $1000$ repeatedly, we get $1000-13=987$, $987-13=974$, $974-13=961$, and so on. We can see that the sequence will continue to decrease until we reach $0$. So, the least positive integer in the sequence is the first term that is greater than $0$. Since the common difference is $-13$, we can add $13$ to the first term to get the least positive integer.

For up to 60 tickets, the price per ticket is $\$70$. However, for more than 60 tickets, the price per ticket decreases by $\$1$ for each additional ticket. So, if $t$ is the number of tickets bought, then the total revenue can be calculated as $70 \times \text{minimum of } t \text{ and } 60$, because we have to consider the price reduction for tickets bought beyond 60. To bring a profit greater than $\$4200$, the total revenue should be more than the total cost. The total cost is given by $70 \times 60$ for the first 60 tickets, plus the cost of the additional tickets beyond 60. The cost of the additional tickets can be calculated as $(t-60) \times (70-1)$. Therefore, the total revenue should be greater than $70 \times 60 + (t-60) \times 69$. We can now set up the inequality $70 \times \text{minimum of } t \text{ and } 60 > 70 \times 60 + (t-60) \times 69$. Since we want to find the largest $t$ for which the profit is greater than $\$4200$, we can solve for the maximum value of $t$ that satisfies this inequality. To do this, let's consider the case when $t \leq 60$, because in this case, the minimum of $t$ and 60 is simply $t$. So, we have $70t > 4200 + (t-60) \times 69$. Rearranging the terms, we get $70t > 4200 + 69t - 4140$. This simplifies to $t > 60$. However, since $t$ should be less than or equal to 60 in this case, there are no solutions for $t \leq 60$. Now, let's consider the case when $t > 60$. In this case, the minimum of $t$ and 60 is 60. So, we have $70 \times 60 > 4200 + (t-60) \times 69$. Rearranging the terms, we get $4200 + (t-60) \times 69 < 4200 + 4200$. This simplifies to $(t-60) \times 69 < 8400$, and further to $t - 60 < 120$. This gives us $t < 180$.

This reduces to $x=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{13}}{2}$. So, the solutions to the equation are $x=\frac{3+\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $x=\frac{3-\sqrt{13}}{2}$. Since we are given that the solutions can be expressed in the form $\frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c}$ and $\frac{a-\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are prime numbers, we can identify $a=3$, $b=13$, and $c=2$. Therefore, the product $abc$ is equal to $3\cdot13\cdot2=78$. </think><answer> 78</answer>"

To do this, we can use the fact that the distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. In this case, we want to minimize the distance between the origin $(0,0)$ and a point $(x,y)$ on the graph of the equation. So, we can write the distance between these two points as $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Since the point $(x,y)$ lies on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$, we can substitute this value of $y$ into the distance equation to get $\sqrt{x^2+(\frac{1}{2}x^2-9)^2}$. To minimize this distance, we can take the derivative of the expression inside the square root with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. This gives us $\frac{x+\frac{1}{2}x^3-18}{\sqrt{x^2+(\frac{1}{2}x^2-9)^2}}=0$. Since the denominator cannot be zero, we can set the numerator equal to zero and solve for $x$. This gives us the equation $x+\frac{1}{2}x^3-18=0$. We can factor out an $x$ from this equation to get $x(1+\frac{1}{2}x^2-18)=0$. This tells us that either $x=0$ or $1+\frac{1}{2}x^2-18=0$. We can ignore the first solution since it corresponds to the point $(0,-9)$ which is not on the graph of the equation. So, we need to solve the equation $1+\frac{1}{2}x^2-18=0$. We can start by combining the constant terms to get $\frac{1}{2}x^2-17=0$. Then, we can add $17$ to both sides to get $\frac{1}{2}x^2=17$. Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives us $x^2=34$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $x=\pm\sqrt{34}$. Now that we have the $x$-coordinates of the points on the graph that are closest to the origin, we can substitute these values into the original equation $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$ to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates. For $x=\sqrt{34}$, we get $y=\frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{34})^2-9=8-9=-1$. For $x=-\sqrt{34}$, we get $y=\frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{34})^2-9=8-9=-1$. So, the two points on the graph that are closest to the origin are $(\sqrt{34},-1)$ and $(-\sqrt{34},-1)$. Now, we can use either of these points to find the distance between the origin and the point on the graph. Using the distance formula, we get $\sqrt{(\sqrt{34})^2+(-1)^2}=\sqrt{34+1}=\sqrt{35}$. Therefore, the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$ is $\sqrt{35}$. To find $a^2$, we simply need to square this distance. So, $a^2=(\sqrt{35})^2=35$.</think><answer> 35</answer>"

To find the sum of the fractions in the 15th row, we need to determine the number of fractions in the 15th row and then find their sum. Let's analyze the pattern and see if we can find a general formula for the number of fractions in the $n$th row. Looking at the given rows, we can observe that the first row has 1 fraction, the second row has 2 fractions, the third row has 3 fractions, and so on. Therefore, the $n$th row has $n$ fractions. Now that we know the number of fractions in each row, we can find the total number of fractions in the first 15 rows. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 15 = \frac{15(15+1)}{2} = 120$. Now that we know the total number of fractions, we can proceed to find the sum of the fractions in the 15th row. The fractions in the $n$th row have denominators $n+1$. Therefore, the sum of the fractions in the 15th row is $\frac{1}{16} + \frac{2}{16} + \frac{3}{16} + \cdots + \frac{15}{16}$. We can simplify this expression by finding the sum of the numerators and dividing it by the common denominator. The sum of the numerators is $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 15$, which we already calculated to be 120.

In this case, the given root is $\frac{13-\sqrt{131}}{4}$, so the other root should be $\frac{13+\sqrt{131}}{4}$. Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to $-b/a$, and the product of the roots is equal to $c/a$. Here, the sum of the roots is $\frac{13-\sqrt{131}}{4} + \frac{13+\sqrt{131}}{4} = \frac{26}{4} = \frac{13}{2}$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{13-\sqrt{131}}{4} * \frac{13+\sqrt{131}}{4} = \frac{169 - 131}{16} = \frac{38}{16} = \frac{19}{8}$.

Since we know that the parabola contains the points (-1,0), (0,5), and (5,0), we can use these points to form three equations. The equation of the parabola is given by $ax^2+bx+c=0$. Plugging in the point (-1,0), we get $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$, which simplifies to $a-b+c=0$. Plugging in the point (0,5), we get $a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5$, which simplifies to $c=5$. Plugging in the point (5,0), we get $a(5)^2+b(5)+c=0$, which simplifies to $25a+5b+c=0. Now we have three equations: $a-b+c=0$, $c=5$, and $25a+5b+c=0. We can substitute the value of c from the second equation into the first and third equations. Substituting c=5 into the first equation, we get $a-b+5=0$, which simplifies to $a-b=-5$. Substituting c=5 into the third equation, we get $25a+5b+5=0$, which simplifies to $25a+5b=-5. Now we have two equations: $a-b=-5$ and $25a+5b=-5. We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Multiplying the first equation by 5, we get $5a-5b=-25$. Adding this equation to the second equation, we get $30a=-30, which simplifies to $a=-1.

We have four cube roots multiplied together: $\sqrt[3]{12}\times \sqrt[3]{20}\times \sqrt[3]{15}\times \sqrt[3]{60}$. To simplify this, we can combine the cube roots using the rule $\sqrt[3]{a}\times \sqrt[3]{b} = \sqrt[3]{ab}$. So, we can rewrite the expression as $\sqrt[3]{12\times 20\times 15\times 60}$. Now, let's simplify the expression inside the cube root by multiplying the numbers together: $12\times 20\times 15\times 60 = 43200$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to $\sqrt[3]{43200}$. Now, let's find the cube root of 43200. We know that $60^3 = 216000$ and $50^3 = 125000$, so the cube root of 43200 must be between 50 and 60. However, since $50^3 = 125000$ is less than 43200, we can try the next integer, which is 51. Calculating $51^3$, we get $51^3 = 132651$. Since $51^3$ is greater than 43200, we know that the cube root of 43200 must be between 50 and 51. Now, let's try 50.5. Calculating $50.5^3$, we get $50.5^3 = 131,757.625$. Since $50.5^3$ is greater than 43200, we know that the cube root of 43200 must be between 50 and 50.5. Now, let's try 50.4. Calculating $50.4^3$, we get $50.4^3 = 131,040$. Since $50.4^3$ is less than 43200 and $50.5^3$ is greater than 43200, we can conclude that the cube root of 43200 is between 50 and 50.4. Continuing this process, we can find that the cube root of 43200 is exactly 51.2, but we can simplify this to $\sqrt[3]{12}\times \sqrt[3]{20}\times \sqrt[3]{15}\times \sqrt[3]{60} = \sqrt[3]{12}\times \sqrt[3]{\frac{3\times 4\times 5}{2}\times 2\times 2\times 3\times 5} = \sqrt[3]{12}\times \sqrt[3]{3\times 4\times 5\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 3\times 5} = \sqrt[3]{12}\times \sqrt[3]{3^2\times 2^3\times 5^2} = \sqrt[3]{12}\times 3\times 2\times 5 = \sqrt[3]{12}\times 30 = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3\times 2^2\times 3}{2}}\times 30 = \sqrt[3]{3\times 3\times 2^2}\times 30 = \sqrt[3]{3^2\times 2^2}\times 30 = 3\times 2\times \sqrt[3]{3}\times 30 = 6\times 30\times \sqrt[3]{3} = 180\times \sqrt[3]{3} = \boxed{180\sqrt[3]{3}}.$</think><answer> $180\sqrt[3]{3}$</answer>"

We can start by using the quadratic formula: t = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = -4.9, b = -3.5, and c = 2.4. Plugging in these values, we get t = (3.5 ± √((-3.5)^2 - 4(-4.9)(2.4))) / (2(-4.9)). Simplifying further, we get t = (3.5 ± √(12.25 + 37.44)) / (-9.8) = (3.5 ± √49.69) / (-9.8) = (3.5 ± 7.04) / (-9.8). Now, we have two possible values for t: t = (3.5 + 7.04) / (-9.8) and t = (3.5 - 7.04) / (-9.8). Calculating these values, we get t = 10.54 / (-9.8) and t = -3.54 / (-9.8). t = 10.54 / (-9.8) is not a valid solution since time cannot be negative. Therefore, t = -3.54 / (-9.8) = 0.36 seconds. So, the ball will hit the ground after approximately 0.36 seconds. </think><answer> 0.36</answer>"

We have two horses, one 64 feet away from the center of a merry-go-round and the other 16 feet away. The first horse makes 27 revolutions, and we want to find out how many revolutions the second horse needs to make to travel the same distance. To approach this, we can use the concept of circumference and the relationship between the radius and the number of revolutions. The distance traveled by each horse is equal to the circumference of the circle it is moving on multiplied by the number of revolutions it makes. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. For the first horse, the circumference is 2π(64) and for the second horse, the circumference is 2π(16). We can set up an equation based on the fact that the distance traveled by both horses is the same. Let's denote the number of revolutions made by the second horse as 'x'. Then, the distance traveled by the first horse is 27 * 2π(64) and the distance traveled by the second horse is x * 2π(16). Since the distances are equal, we can set up the equation: 27 * 2π(64) = x * 2π(16). Now, we can solve for 'x'. First, we can cancel out the common factor of 2π from both sides of the equation. This gives us: 27 * 64 = x * 16. Next, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by multiplying 27 and 64. This gives us: 1728 = x * 16. Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 16. This gives us: x = 1728 / 16 = 108. Therefore, the second horse would have to make 108 revolutions to travel the same distance as the first horse. </think><answer> 108 </answer>"

We are looking for multiples of 3 within this range. To find the first multiple of 3, we can start by dividing 100 by 3, which gives us approximately 33.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 34. This means the first multiple of 3 in the range is 3 * 34 = 102. Similarly, to find the last multiple of 3 in the range, we can divide 200 by 3, which gives us approximately 66.67. Rounding down to the nearest whole number, we get 66. This means the last multiple of 3 in the range is 3 * 66 = 198. Now, we need to find all the multiples of 3 between 102 and 198. We can do this by finding the difference between the last and first multiples, dividing by 3, and adding 1. The difference between 198 and 102 is 96, and dividing by 3 gives us 32. Adding 1 to this result gives us 33. This means there are 33 multiples of 3 between 102 and 198. To find the sum of all these multiples, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. In this case, n = 33, the first term is 102, and the last term is 198. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: sum = (33/2) * (102 + 198) = 16.5 * 300 = 4950. Therefore, the sum of all multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 is 4950. </think><answer> 4950 </answer>"

We are also given that the sum of these two numbers is 123422. To find the value of A + M + C, we can start by adding the two numbers and then equating the sum to 123422. Let's represent the two numbers as 10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E and 10000M + 1000N + 100O + 10P + Q. The sum of these two numbers is 123422, so we can set up the equation (10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E) + (10000M + 1000N + 100O + 10P + Q) = 123422. Simplifying this equation, we get 10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E + 10000M + 1000N + 100O + 10P + Q = 123422.

Now, we can equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of 10 on both sides of the equation. Equating the coefficients of the 10000 power of 10, we get A + M = 12. Equating the coefficients of the 1000 power of 10, we get B + N = 2. Equating the coefficients of the 100 power of 10, we get C + O = 22. Equating the coefficients of the 10 power of 10, we get D + P = 4. Equating the coefficients of the 1 power of 10, we get E + Q = 2. Now, we have a system of equations with five variables. We can use these equations to find the values of A, M, C, O, D, P, E, and Q. Solving the system of equations, we find that A = 1, M = 11, C = 2, O = 0, D = 4, P = 0, E = 2, and Q = 0.

This gives us the equation $p + q = pq$. We are also given that the difference between $p$ and $q$ is $7$, so we can write $p - q = 7$. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $p$ and $q$. From the second equation, we can express $p$ as $p = q + 7$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $q + 7 + q = q(q + 7)$, which simplifies to $2q + 7 = q^2 + 7q$. Rearranging this equation, we get $q^2 + 5q = 0$, which factors as $q(q + 5) = 0$. This gives us two possible values for $q$: $q = 0$ or $q = -5$. Since $p$ and $q$ are both positive, we must have $q = -5$ is not a valid solution, so $q = 0$ is also not valid. Therefore, we made a mistake in our solution so lets try again. From the second equation, we can express $q$ as $q = p - 7$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $p + p - 7 = p(p - 7)$, which simplifies to $2p - 7 = p^2 - 7p$. Rearranging this equation, we get $p^2 - 9p + 7 = 0$. Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $p$. The quadratic formula gives us $p = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -9$, and $c = 7$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $p = \frac{-(-9) \pm \sqrt{(-9)^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 28}}{2} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{53}}{2}$. Therefore, we have two possible values for $p$: $p = \frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}$ or $p = \frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}$. Now that we have the values of $p$ and $q$, we can find the value of $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}}$. Using the values of $p$ and $q$ we just found, we get $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2}+\frac{1}{\left(\frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{4}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2}+\frac{4}{(9 - \sqrt{53})^2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{4(9 - \sqrt{53})^2 + 4(9 + \sqrt{53})^2}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(9 - \sqrt{53})^2}} = \frac{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(9 - \sqrt{53})^2}{4[(9 - \sqrt{53})^2(9 + \sqrt{53})^2]} = \frac{(9 + \sqrt{53})(9 - \sqrt{53})}{4[(9 - \sqrt{53})(9 + \sqrt{53})]} = \frac{9^2 - (\sqrt{53})^2}{4(9^2 - (\sqrt{53})^2)} = \frac{81 - 53}{4(81 - 53)} = \frac{28}{4(28)} = \frac{1}{2}$. However, we made another mistake. $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{q^2 + p^2}{p^2q^2}} = \frac{p^2q^2}{q^2 + p^2} = \frac{p^2}{\frac{q^2}{p^2}+1} = \frac{p^2}{\frac{q^2}{p^2}+1} = \frac{p^2}{\frac{q^2 + p^2}{p^2}} = \frac{p^4}{q^2 + p^2}$. Now, we substitute $p = \frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}$ and $q = \frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}$ into the equation. We get $\frac{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^4}{\left(\frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^4}{\left(\frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^4}{\frac{81 - 53}{4} + \frac{81 + 53}{4}} = \frac{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^4}{\frac{28}{4} + \frac{134}{4}} = \frac{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^4}{\frac{162}{4}} = \frac{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^4}{\frac{81}{2}} = \frac{2\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^4}{81} = \frac{2\left(\frac{9^4 + 4 \cdot 9^3\sqrt{53} + 6 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 53 + 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 53\sqrt{53} + 53^2}{16}\right)}{81} = \frac{\left(\frac{9^4 + 4 \cdot 9^3\sqrt{53} + 6 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 53 + 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 53\sqrt{53} + 53^2}{16}\right)}{\frac{81}{2}} = \frac{2\left(9^4 + 4 \cdot 9^3\sqrt{53} + 6 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 53 + 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 53\sqrt{53} + 53^2\right)}{81 \cdot 16} = \frac{2\left(6561 + 2916\sqrt{53} + 2268 \cdot 53 + 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 53\sqrt{53} + 2809\right)}{1296} = \frac{2\left(6561 + 2916\sqrt{53} + 119964 + 4 \cdot 477\sqrt{53} + 2809\right)}{1296} = \frac{2\left(1462534 + 2916\sqrt{53} + 4 \cdot 477\sqrt{53}\right)}{1296} = \frac{2\left(1462534 + 2916\sqrt{53} + 1908\sqrt{53}\right)}{1296} = \frac{2\left(1462534 + 4824\sqrt{53}\right)}{1296} = \frac{1462534 + 4824\sqrt{53}}{648} = \frac{22679 + 4824\sqrt{53}}{108}$. Now we have $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{22679 + 4824\sqrt{53}}{108}$. Since $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{pq}{p^2 + q^2}$, we can substitute $p = \frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}$ and $q = \frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}$ into the equation. We get $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2} \cdot \frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}}{\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{9 - \sqrt{53}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{81 - 53}{4}}{\frac{81 + 53}{4}} = \frac{28}{134} = \frac{14}{67}$. Now we have $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{14}{67}$. We were supposed to get $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{a + b \sqrt{c}}{d}$ where $a$ and $b$ don't both share the same common factor with $d$ and $c$ has no square as a factor. We can simplify $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{14}{67}$ to $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{2 \cdot 7}{67} = \frac{2}{67} \cdot 7 = \frac{2}{67} \cdot (1 + 6) = \frac{2}{67} + \frac{12}{67} = \frac{14}{67}$. Now we have $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{14}{67}$ which is already in the desired form. Therefore, $a = 14$, $b = 0$, $c = 67$, and $d = 67$. We can now find the sum $a + b + c + d$. $a + b + c + d = 14 + 0 + 67 + 67 = 148$. </think><answer> 148 </answer>"

The average of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 2. So, we have $\frac{a + 2b}{2} = 7$ and $\frac{a + 2c}{2} = 8$. We can simplify these equations by multiplying both sides of each equation by 2. This gives us $a + 2b = 14$ and $a + 2c = 16$. Now, let's try to isolate the variable a. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives us $2c - 2b = 2$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $c - b = 1$. Now, we need to find the average of the three numbers. The average is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by the number of terms. In this case, we have $a$, $b$, and $c$, so the average is $\frac{a + b + c}{3}$. Now we need to find the value of $a + b + c$. Adding the two equations $a + 2b = 14$ and $a + 2c = 16$ together gives us $2a + 2b + 2c = 30$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $a + b + c = 15$. Now, we can find the average by plugging in $a + b + c = 15$ into the formula for the average: $\frac{a + b + c}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5$. So, the average of the three numbers is 5. </think><answer> 5</answer>"

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by $\frac{a}{1-r}$. We are given that the sum of the original series is 2000, so we have the equation $\frac{a}{1-r} = 2000$. Additionally, we know that the new series, obtained by squaring each term of the original series, has a sum that is 16 times the sum of the original series. This means that the sum of the new series is $16 \times 2000 = 32000$. The sum of the new series can be expressed as $\frac{a^2}{1-r^2}$. Setting this equal to 32000, we get the equation $\frac{a^2}{1-r^2} = 32000$. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $a$ and $r$. From the first equation, we can express $a$ in terms of $r$ as $a = 2000(1-r)$. Substituting this expression for $a$ into the second equation, we get $\frac{(2000(1-r))^2}{1-r^2} = 32000$. Simplifying this equation, we have $\frac{4000000(1-r)^2}{1-r^2} = 32000$. Canceling out the common factor of $4000000$ and simplifying further, we get $\frac{(1-r)^2}{1-r^2} = \frac{1}{100}$. Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we have $(1-r)^2 = \frac{1-r^2}{100}$. Multiplying both sides by 100 and expanding the left-hand side, we get $100 - 200r + 100r^2 = 1 - r^2$. Combining like terms and rearranging, we have $101r^2 - 200r + 99 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $r$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Applying this formula to our quadratic equation, we have $r = \frac{-(-200) \pm \sqrt{(-200)^2 - 4(101)(99)}}{2(101)}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $r = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{40000 - 39996}}{202}$. This simplifies to $r = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{4}}{202}$. Therefore, $r = \frac{200 \pm 2}{202}$. This gives us two possible values for $r$: $r = \frac{200 + 2}{202} = \frac{202}{202} = 1$ and $r = \frac{200 - 2}{202} = \frac{198}{202} = \frac{99}{101}$. Since $r$ is the common ratio of a geometric series, it cannot be equal to 1. Therefore, we must have $r = \frac{99}{101}$. Now that we have found the value of $r$, we can substitute it back into the equation $\frac{a}{1-r} = 2000$ to find the value of $a$. Substituting $r = \frac{99}{101}$, we get $\frac{a}{1-\frac{99}{101}} = 2000$. Simplifying the denominator, we have $\frac{a}{\frac{2}{101}} = 2000$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2}{101}$, we get $a = 2000 \times \frac{2}{101}$. Therefore, $a = \frac{4000}{101}$. Now that we have found the values of $a$ and $r$, we can express the common ratio as a fraction. We have $r = \frac{99}{101}$. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $99 + 101 = 200$. </think><answer> 200</answer>"

Since there are 12 people and they are getting equal daily shares, we can calculate the total number of shares by dividing the total number of people (12 + 3 = 15) by the original number of people (12). However, since the problem states that the original daily share for each person is not changed, the total number of shares will be the same as the original number of people, which is 12. Now we can calculate the total number of shares by multiplying the number of people by the number of days: 12 * 10 = 120. Since 12 people are getting the same daily share, the total number of shares is 120. Next, we can calculate the new daily share by dividing the total number of shares (120) by the new total number of people (15): 120 / 15 = 8. Now that we know the new daily share, we can calculate the number of days the supplies will last by dividing the total number of shares (120) by the new daily share (8): 120 / 8 = 15. Therefore, the supplies will last for 15 days. </think><answer> 15</answer>"

The first term is 13 and the common difference is 7 (20 - 13 = 7, 27 - 20 = 7, and so on). To find the number of terms in the sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference. We know that the last term in the sequence is 2008, so we can set up the equation 2008 = 13 + (n - 1)7 and solve for n. First, subtract 13 from both sides to get 1995 = (n - 1)7. Then, divide both sides by 7 to get 285 = n - 1. Finally, add 1 to both sides to get n = 286. Therefore, there are 286 terms in the sequence. </think><answer> 286</answer>"

The slope between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Let's calculate the slope for each pair of points. For points $(2, 2)$ and $(9, 11)$, the slope is $\frac{11 - 2}{9 - 2} = \frac{9}{7}$. For points $(2, 2)$ and $(5, 7)$, the slope is $\frac{7 - 2}{5 - 2} = \frac{5}{3}$. For points $(2, 2)$ and $(11, 17)$, the slope is $\frac{17 - 2}{11 - 2} = \frac{15}{9} = \frac{5}{3}$. For points $(9, 11)$ and $(5, 7)$, the slope is $\frac{7 - 11}{5 - 9} = \frac{-4}{-4} = 1$. For points $(9, 11)$ and $(11, 17)$, the slope is $\frac{17 - 11}{11 - 9} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$. For points $(5, 7)$ and $(11, 17)$, the slope is $\frac{17 - 7}{11 - 5} = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3}$.
