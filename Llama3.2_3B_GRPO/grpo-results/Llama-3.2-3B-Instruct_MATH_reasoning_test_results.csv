The powers of 'i' cycle every four powers: i^1 = i, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, and i^4 = 1. We can use this property to simplify each term in the given expression. For i^5, we can rewrite it as i^(4+1) = i^4 * i^1 = 1 * i = i. For i^-25, we can rewrite it as i^(-24-1) = i^(-24) * i^(-1). Since i^4 = 1, i^(-24) = i^0 = 1. Therefore, i^-25 = 1 * i^-1 = 1/i. For i^45, we can rewrite it as i^(44+1) = i^(4*11+1) = (i^4)^11 * i^1 = 1^11 * i = i. Now, we can substitute these simplified values back into the original expression: i^5 + i^-25 + i^45 = i + 1/i + i. We can further simplify 1/i by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by i: 1/i = 1/i * i/i = i/i^2 = i/(-1) = -i.

$a+b=10$,
$a+c=18$,
$a+d=19$,
$b+c=20$,

We can start by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to get $c-b=8$. Similarly, subtracting the first equation from the third equation gives us $d-b=9$. Subtracting the fourth equation from the fifth equation gives us $d-c=1$. We now have a system of equations:

$c-b=8$,
$d-b=9$,
$d-c=1

We can add the first two equations to get $d-c+2b=17$. Subtracting the third equation from this gives us $2b=16$, so $b=8$. Substituting $b=8$ into $c-b=8$ gives us $c=16$. Substituting $b=8$ into $d-b=9$ gives us $d=17.

Now that we know the values of $b$, $c$, and $d$, we can find $a$ by substituting $b=8$ into $a+b=10$, which gives us $a=2.

We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by $2\sqrt{3}$, which is the conjugate of the denominator. This will eliminate the square root in the denominator, but we need to be careful about the sign. Multiplying by $2\sqrt{3}$ is equivalent to multiplying by $2\sqrt{3} \times 2\sqrt{3}$, which is $12$. So, we get $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} \times 2\sqrt{3} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}} \times 2\sqrt{3}$. This simplifies to $\frac{2A\sqrt{3B}}{C} = 9$. Now, we can cross-multiply to get $2A\sqrt{3B} = 9C$. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(2A\sqrt{3B})^2 = 9^2C^2$, which simplifies to $4A^2 \times 3B = 81C^2$. This can be further simplified to $12A^2B = 81C^2$. Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12 to get $A^2B = \frac{81}{12}C^2$, which simplifies to $A^2B = \frac{27}{4}C^2$. Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, we can conclude that $A^2$ must be a multiple of 4, and $C^2$ must be a multiple of 4. This means that $A$ must be a multiple of 2, and $C$ must be a multiple of 2. Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by $C^2$ to get $A^2B/C^2 = 27/4$. We can now substitute $A = 2k$ and $C = 2m$, where $k$ and $m$ are positive integers with no common prime factors. Substituting these values, we get $(2k)^2B/(2m)^2 = 27/4$, which simplifies to $4k^2B/m^2 = 27/4$. Now, we can cross-multiply to get $16k^2B = 27m^2$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 16, we get $k^2B = \frac{27}{16}m^2$. Now, we can see that $B$ must be a multiple of 16, and $m$ must be a multiple of 16. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we can conclude that $B$ must be equal to 16. Substituting this value back into the equation, we get $k^2 \times 16 = \frac{27}{16}m^2$. This can be further simplified to $16k^2 = \frac{27}{16}m^2$. Now, we can cross-multiply to get $16^2k^2 = 27m^2$. This simplifies to $256k^2 = 27m^2$. Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 256 to get $k^2 = \frac{27}{256}m^2$. Now, we can see that $k$ must be equal to 3, and $m$ must be equal to 16. Substituting these values back into the equation $A = 2k$, we get $A = 2 \times 3 = 6$. Substituting these values back into the equation $C = 2m$, we get $C = 2 \times 16 = 32$. Now, we can find the value of $B$ by substituting the values of $A$ and $C$ back into the original equation. We get $\frac{6\sqrt{B}}{32} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$. This simplifies to $6\sqrt{B} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}} \times 32$, which further simplifies to $6\sqrt{B} = 48\sqrt{3}$. Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6 to get $\sqrt{B} = 8\sqrt{3}$. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $B = (8\sqrt{3})^2$, which simplifies to $B = 192$. Now, we can find the value of $A+B+C$ by adding the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$. We get $A+B+C = 6+192+32 = 230$. </think><answer> 230 </answer>"

Since $m$ is the sum of two prime numbers, the possible values of $m$ are 2 + 3 = 5, 2 + 5 = 7, 2 + 7 = 9, 2 + 11 = 13, 2 + 13 = 15, 3 + 5 = 8, 3 + 7 = 10, 3 + 11 = 14, 3 + 13 = 16, 5 + 7 = 12, 5 + 11 = 16, and 5 + 13 = 18. Now, we need to find the corresponding values of $n$ for each possible value of $m$. We can do this by finding the prime factorization of each $m$. For example, for $m = 5$, we have $r = 2$ and $s = 3$, so $n = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$. Similarly, for $m = 7$, we have $r = 2$ and $s = 5$, so $n = 2 \cdot 5 = 10$. We can continue this process for all possible values of $m$. However, we only need to consider the values of $n$ that are less than 20, since $m < 20$. So, we can stop when we reach $m = 19$. Now, let's count the number of possible values of $n$. We have $n = 6$ for $m = 5$, $n = 10$ for $m = 7$, $n = 9$ for $m = 8$ (since $r$ and $s$ can be 2 and 3 or 3 and 2), $n = 14$ for $m = 10$ (since $r$ and $s$ can be 2 and 3 or 3 and 2), $n = 16$ for $m = 12$ and $m = 16$, $n = 15$ for $m = 13$, and $n = 18$ for $m = 14$. Therefore, the possible values of $n$ are 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 18, and there are 6 possible values of $n$.</think><answer>6</answer>"

The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $b^2-4ac$. In this case, the discriminant is $(-7)^2-4(1)(c)$. For the roots to be real, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero. So, we have $49-4c\geq0$. Solving for c, we get $c\leq\frac{49}{4}$.

We can create a system of linear equations to represent the given information. The first equation represents the cost of eight pounds of feathers and two ounces of gold, which is $\$932$. This can be written as: 8F + 2G = 932. The second equation represents the cost of fourteen pounds of feathers and three ounces of gold, which is $\$1402$. This can be written as: 14F + 3G = 1402. Now, we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of F and G. We can use the method of substitution or elimination to solve this system. Let's use the elimination method. First, we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G the same: 24F + 6G = 2796 and 28F + 6G = 2804. Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate G: (28F - 24F) + (6G - 6G) = 2804 - 2796. This simplifies to 4F = 8. Dividing both sides by 4, we get F = 2. Now that we have found F, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find G. Let's use the first equation: 8F + 2G = 932. Substituting F = 2, we get 8(2) + 2G = 932. This simplifies to 16 + 2G = 932. Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2G = 916. Dividing both sides by 2, we get G = 458.

The cost of five ounces of gold is 5G = 5(458) = 2290. Therefore, the total cost is 10 + 2290 = 2300. </think><answer> 2300 </answer>"

We can see that the points (2, -5), (p, -14), and (p+2, -17) lie on a straight line. To find the equation of the line, we can calculate the slope using any two points. Let's use the points (2, -5) and (p+2, -17). The slope is given by (-17 - (-5)) / (p+2 - 2) = -12 / (p) = -12p. Now, we can use the point (2, -5) to find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. We have -5 = -12p(2) + b, which simplifies to b = -5 + 24p. Now, we can use the point (p, -14) to find the value of p. We have -14 = -12p(p) + b, which simplifies to -14 = -12p^2 + 24p. Rearranging the equation, we get 12p^2 - 24p - 14 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get p = 7/3 or p = -1/3. However, if p = -1/3, then the point (p+2, -17) would have a negative x-coordinate, which is not possible. Therefore, p = 7/3. Now that we have the value of p, we can find the equation of the line. Substituting p = 7/3 into the equation b = -5 + 24p, we get b = -5 + 24(7/3) = -5 + 56 = 51. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = -12p(x) + 51.

This can be done by finding the values of $x$ that satisfy the individual inequalities $x^{4}+4x^{2}>-4$ and $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$. We can start by factoring the left-hand side of the first inequality: $x^{4}+4x^{2}>-4 \Rightarrow (x^{2}+2)^{2}>0$. Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, this inequality is satisfied for all real values of $x$. Now, let's consider the second inequality: $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21 \Rightarrow (x^{2}+2)^{2}<21$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|x^{2}+2|<\sqrt{21}$. Since $x^{2}+2$ is always positive, we can remove the absolute value signs and write $x^{2}+2<\sqrt{21}$. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get $x^{2}<\sqrt{21}-2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|x|<\sqrt{\sqrt{21}-2}$. Since $\sqrt{21}-2$ is approximately 1.58, we can approximate the upper bound of $x$ as $\sqrt{1.58} \approx 1.25$. Similarly, we can find the lower bound of $x$ by considering the inequality $x^{4}+4x^{2}>-4$. We can factor the left-hand side of this inequality as $(x^{2}+2)^{2}>0$, which is satisfied for all real values of $x$. Therefore, the lower bound of $x$ is unbounded.

To do this, we will complete the square for both x and y terms in the given equation. This will give us the equation of a circle and we can find its center and radius. Then, we can use the fact that the maximum value of y will occur at the topmost point of the circle, which is the center of the circle plus the radius in the y-direction. </think>
<answer> We start by completing the square for both x and y terms. The given equation is x^2 + y^2 = 14x + 48y. To complete the square, we group the x terms and y terms separately and move the constant term to the right-hand side. This gives us x^2 - 14x + y^2 - 48y = 0. Now, we add (14/2)^2 = 49 and (48/2)^2 = 576 to both sides of the equation to complete the square. This gives us x^2 - 14x + 49 + y^2 - 48y + 576 = 625. We can now rewrite this as (x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 = 625. This is the equation of a circle with center (7, 24) and radius 25. Since the center of the circle is at (7, 24) and the radius is 25, the maximum value of y will occur at the topmost point of the circle, which is 24 + 25 = 49. </answer>"

In this case, the number of books sold per month is given by the expression $128-4p$, and the price per book is $p$. So, the revenue can be represented as the product of these two expressions: $R(p) = (128-4p)p$. To find the maximum revenue, we need to maximize this expression. This can be done by finding the critical points of the function $R(p)$, which are the values of $p$ where the derivative of $R(p)$ is equal to zero or undefined. To find the derivative of $R(p)$, we can use the product rule of differentiation: $R'(p) = 128 - 8p$. Now, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $p$: $128 - 8p = 0 \Rightarrow 8p = 128 \Rightarrow p = 16$. This means that the price of $16$ dollars is a critical point of the function $R(p)$. To determine whether this point corresponds to a maximum, we need to examine the second derivative of $R(p)$, which is $R''(p) = -8$. Since the second derivative is negative, the critical point $p = 16$ corresponds to a maximum. Therefore, the bookstore should charge $\$16$ for the book to maximize its revenue.</answer>"

Now, we can rewrite the equation as $\frac{\frac{7}{6}}{w} = \frac{42}{3}$. To divide by $w$, we can multiply by the reciprocal of $w$, which gives us $\frac{7}{6} \times \frac{1}{w} = \frac{42}{3}$. Now, we can cross multiply to get $7 \times 3 = 42 \times w$. Simplifying this, we get $21 = 42w$. To solve for $w$, we can divide both sides by $42$, which gives us $w = \frac{21}{42}$.

By observing the given terms, we can see that each term decreases by 13. So, the common difference (d) is -13. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference. Here, $a_1$ is 1000 and d is -13. We want to find the least positive integer, which means we need to find the smallest value of n for which $a_n$ is positive. To do this, we can set up the inequality $a_n = 1000 + (n-1)(-13) > 0$ and solve for n. </think>
<answer> 1000 + (n-1)(-13) > 0
1000 - 13n + 13 > 0
-13n > -1013
n > 77.23
Since n must be an integer, the smallest value of n that satisfies the inequality is 78. We can now find the corresponding term: $a_{78} = 1000 + (78-1)(-13) = 1000 - 77*13 = 1000 - 1001 = -1. So, the least positive integer in the sequence is actually the term that comes after -1, which is $a_{79} = 1000 - 78*13 = 1000 - 1014 = -14. However, since we are looking for the least positive integer, we need to continue until we find a positive term. Continuing this process, we find that the least positive integer in the sequence is $a_{1000} = 1000 - 999*13 = 1000 - 12987 = 11613.

We know that $\sqrt{2}$ can be written as $2^{\frac{1}{2}}$. So, we have $\log_28\sqrt{2} = \log_28 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}$. Next, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\log_ab^c = c \cdot \log_ab$. Applying this property, we get $\log_28 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \log_28$. Now, we need to find the value of $\log_28$. We can rewrite $8$ as $2^3$. So, we have $\log_28 = \log_2(2^3)$. Using the property of logarithms that states $\log_ab^c = c \cdot \log_ab$, we get $\log_2(2^3) = 3 \cdot \log_22$. Since $\log_ab = 1$ when $a = b$, we have $\log_22 = 1$. Therefore, $\log_28 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$. Finally, we substitute this value back into our expression: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \log_28 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 = \frac{3}{2}.</think><answer> $\frac{3}{2}$ </answer>"

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the number of tickets sold multiplied by the price per ticket, and the total cost is the number of tickets sold multiplied by the cost per ticket. Since we have two different prices depending on whether the order is for 60 tickets or more, we need to consider both cases. For the first case, when $t \le 60$, the price per ticket is $\$70$, so the revenue is $70t$ and the cost is $70t$. For the second case, when $t > 60$, the price per ticket is $70 - (t-60)$, so the revenue is $(70 - (t-60))t$ and the cost is $(70 - (t-60))t$. We want to find the largest $t$ such that the profit is greater than $\$4200$. This means that $(70 - (t-60))t - (70t) > 4200$. Simplifying this inequality gives us $-t^2 + 130t - 4200 > 0$. Rearranging this inequality gives us $t^2 - 130t + 4200 < 0$. We can solve this quadratic inequality by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us $(t - 60)(t - 70) < 0$. The solutions to this inequality are $60 < t < 70$. Since $t$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $t$ is $69$. </think><answer> 69 </answer>"

We can use the property $\log_{a}(b \cdot c) = \log_{a}(b) + \log_{a}(c)$ and the property $\log_{a}(\sqrt{b}) = \frac{1}{2}\log_{a}(b)$. Here, we need to apply these properties to simplify the expression $\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{8})$. We can start by expressing $64\sqrt{8}$ as $64\cdot\sqrt{8}$. Then we can rewrite $\sqrt{8}$ as $8^{\frac{1}{2}}$. Now we have $\log_{\sqrt8}(64\cdot8^{\frac{1}{2}})$. Using the property $\log_{a}(b \cdot c) = \log_{a}(b) + \log_{a}(c)$, we can rewrite this as $\log_{\sqrt8}(64) + \log_{\sqrt8}(8^{\frac{1}{2}})$. Now we can simplify $\log_{\sqrt8}(64)$ and $\log_{\sqrt8}(8^{\frac{1}{2}})$ separately. $\log_{\sqrt8}(64)$ can be rewritten as $\log_{\sqrt8}(8^2)$, and using the property $\log_{a}(a^b) = b$, we get $2$. Similarly, $\log_{\sqrt8}(8^{\frac{1}{2}})$ can be rewritten as $\log_{\sqrt8}(8^{\frac{1}{2}})$, and using the property $\log_{a}(a^b) = b$, we get $\frac{1}{2}$. Now we have $2 + \frac{1}{2}$. So the expression $\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{8})$ simplifies to $2 + \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the value of $\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{8})$ is $\frac{5}{2}$. </think><answer> $\frac{5}{2}$ </answer>"

We can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the elimination method. If we add the two equations together, we get (m+n) + (m+n) = 8 + 8, which simplifies to 2m + 2n = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get m + n = 8. We already knew this, but let's continue. Now, if we subtract the second equation from the first equation, we get (m+n) - (m+n) = 8 - 7, which simplifies to 0 = 1. This is a contradiction, so our original equations must be inconsistent. However, we can still solve for m and n using the first equation. We can express n as n = 7/m. Substituting this into the second equation, we get m + 7/m = 8. Multiplying both sides by m, we get m^2 + 7 = 8m. Rearranging the equation, we get m^2 - 8m + 7 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (m-7)(m-1) = 0. Solving for m, we get m = 7 or m = 1. Now that we have the values of m, we can find the values of n. If m = 7, then n = 1. If m = 1, then n = 7. Since the problem asks for |m-n|, we can plug in either value of m and n.

This can be achieved by finding the minimum value of the function y = (1/2)x^2 - 9. Since the function is quadratic, its minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b / 2a, where a and b are the coefficients of x^2 and x respectively. In this case, a = 1/2 and b = 0. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is x = 0. Now that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging x = 0 into the equation y = (1/2)x^2 - 9. This gives us y = -9. Therefore, the point on the graph that is closest to the origin is (0, -9). The distance between the origin and this point can be found using the distance formula: distance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(81) = 9.

The first step is to expand the left side of the equation using the distributive property. This will give us: $(\sqrt{12x}+12)(\sqrt{3x}-6) = \sqrt{12x} \times \sqrt{3x} - \sqrt{12x} \times 6 + 12 \times \sqrt{3x} - 12 \times 6$. Simplifying further, we get: $\sqrt{36x^2} - 6\sqrt{12x} + 12\sqrt{3x} - 72$. Now, let's simplify the square root terms: $\sqrt{36x^2} = 6x$ and $\sqrt{12x} = 2\sqrt{3x}$. Substituting these values back into the equation, we get: $6x - 12\sqrt{3x} + 12\sqrt{3x} - 72 = 4(x+3)+x-34$. Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation: $4(x+3)+x-34 = 4x + 12 + x - 34 = 5x - 22$. Now we have: $6x - 72 = 5x - 22$. Now, let's isolate the variable $x$ by subtracting $5x$ from both sides: $x - 72 = -22$. Now, let's add $72$ to both sides: $x = 50$. Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x = 50$. </think><answer> x = 50 </answer>"

To solve this, we can first represent the two numbers as 10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E and 10000A + 1000C + 100B + 10D + 2E, where A, B, C, D, and E are the digits of the numbers. We are given that their sum is 123422, so we can set up an equation to represent this: (10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E) + (10000A + 1000C + 100B + 10D + 2E) = 123422. Simplifying this equation, we get 20000A + 1100B + 1100C + 20D + 3E = 123422. Since A, B, C, D, and E are all digits, they must be between 0 and 9. We also know that the sum of the two numbers is 5 digits long, so the sum of B and E must be at least 0, and the sum of C and E must be at least 0. Also, the sum of A, B, C, D, and E must be at most 45. Now, we can try to find a solution by plugging in different values for A, B, C, D, and E that satisfy these conditions. We can start by trying A = 1, and then see if we can find a solution for B, C, D, and E that satisfies the equation and the conditions. If we try A = 1, we get 20000(1) + 1100B + 1100C + 20D + 3E = 123422. Simplifying this equation, we get 1100B + 1100C + 20D + 3E = 123422 - 20000 = 102422. Now, we can see that B, C, D, and E must all be positive integers, and their sum must be at most 33. We can try different values for B, C, D, and E that satisfy these conditions, and see if we can find a solution.

This can be expressed as an equation: $p + q = pq$. We are also given that their difference is $7$, which can be written as $p - q = 7$. We can use these two equations to solve for $p$ and $q$. By rearranging the second equation, we get $q = p - 7$. Now, we substitute this expression for $q$ into the first equation: $p + (p - 7) = p(p - 7)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $2p - 7 = p^2 - 7p$. Rearranging the terms, we have $p^2 - 9p + 7 = 0$. Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $p$: $p = \frac{-(-9) \pm \sqrt{(-9)^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)}$. Simplifying this, we get $p = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 28}}{2}$. Therefore, $p = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{53}}{2}$. Since $p$ is a positive number, we take the positive square root: $p = \frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2}$. Now, we can substitute this expression for $p$ back into the equation $q = p - 7$ to solve for $q$: $q = \frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2} - 7$. Simplifying this, we get $q = \frac{9 + \sqrt{53} - 14}{2}$. Therefore, $q = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{53}}{2}$. Now that we have the values of $p$ and $q$, we can find $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}}$. First, we need to find $\frac{1}{p^2}$ and $\frac{1}{q^2}$. $\frac{1}{p^2} = \frac{1}{(\frac{9 + \sqrt{53}}{2})^2}$. Simplifying this, we get $\frac{1}{p^2} = \frac{4}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2}$. Similarly, $\frac{1}{q^2} = \frac{1}{(\frac{-5 + \sqrt{53}}{2})^2}$. Simplifying this, we get $\frac{1}{q^2} = \frac{4}{(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}$. Now, we can substitute these expressions into the original equation: $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{q^2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{4}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2} + \frac{4}{(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}}$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is $(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as $\frac{1}{\frac{4(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2} + \frac{4(9 + \sqrt{53})^2}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}}$. Simplifying this, we get $\frac{1}{\frac{4(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2 + 4(9 + \sqrt{53})^2}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}}$. Factoring out $4$ from the numerator, we get $\frac{1}{\frac{4((-5 + \sqrt{53})^2 + (9 + \sqrt{53})^2)}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}}}$. Simplifying the numerator, we get $\frac{1}{\frac{4(53 + 2\sqrt{53}(-5 + 9))}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}}}$. Simplifying further, we get $\frac{1}{\frac{4(53 + 2\sqrt{53}(4))}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}}}$. Simplifying the numerator again, we get $\frac{1}{\frac{4(53 + 8\sqrt{53})}{(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2}}}$. Now, we can simplify the denominator: $(9 + \sqrt{53})^2(-5 + \sqrt{53})^2 = ((9 + \sqrt{53})(-5 + \sqrt{53}))^2$. Using the difference of squares, we get $((9 + \sqrt{53})(-5 + \sqrt{53}))^2 = (9(-5) + 9(\sqrt{53}) + \sqrt{53}(-5) + \sqrt{53}(\sqrt{53}))^2$. Simplifying this, we get $(45 + 9\sqrt{53} - 5\sqrt{53} - 5\sqrt{53})^2$. Combining like terms, we get $(40 + 4\sqrt{53})^2$. Expanding this, we get $1600 + 320\sqrt{53} + 16(53)$. Simplifying this, we get $1600 + 320\sqrt{53} + 848$. Combining like terms, we get $2448 + 320\sqrt{53}$. Therefore, the denominator becomes $\frac{1}{\frac{4(53 + 8\sqrt{53})}{2448 + 320\sqrt{53}}}$. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as $\frac{1}{\frac{4(53 + 8\sqrt{53})}{2448 + 320\sqrt{53}}} = \frac{4(53 + 8\sqrt{53})}{2448 + 320\sqrt{53}}$. Now, we can simplify the fraction: $\frac{4(53 + 8\sqrt{53})}{2448 + 320\sqrt{53}} = \frac{4(53) + 4(8\sqrt{53})}{2448 + 320\sqrt{53}}$. Simplifying the numerator, we get $\frac{212 + 32\sqrt{53}}{2448 + 320\sqrt{53}}$. Now, we can factor out $4$ from the denominator: $\frac{212 + 32\sqrt{53}}{2448 + 320\sqrt{53}} = \frac{212 + 32\sqrt{53}}{4(612 + 80\sqrt{53})}$. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as $\frac{212 + 32\sqrt{53}}{4(612 + 80\sqrt{53})} = \frac{212}{4(612 + 80\sqrt{53})} + \frac{32\sqrt{53}}{4(612 + 80\sqrt{53})}$. Simplifying the first fraction, we get $\frac{53}{612 + 80\sqrt{53}}$. Now, we can simplify the second fraction: $\frac{32\sqrt{53}}{4(612 + 80\sqrt{53})} = \frac{8\sqrt{53}}{612 + 80\sqrt{53}}$. Now, we can combine the two fractions: $\frac{53}{612 + 80\sqrt{53}} + \frac{8\sqrt{53}}{612 + 80\sqrt{53}} = \frac{53 + 8\sqrt{53}}{612 + 80\sqrt{53}}$. Now, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: $\frac{53 + 8\sqrt{53}}{612 + 80\sqrt{53}} = \frac{(53 + 8\sqrt{53})(612 - 80\sqrt{53})}{(612 + 80\sqrt{53})(612 - 80\sqrt{53})}$. Expanding the numerator, we get $(53 + 8\sqrt{53})(612 - 80\sqrt{53}) = 53(612) - 53(80\sqrt{53}) + 8\sqrt{53}(612) - 8\sqrt{53}(80\sqrt{53})$. Simplifying this, we get $32316 - 4240\sqrt{53} + 4896\sqrt{53} - 3360(53)$. Combining like terms, we get $32316 - 4240\sqrt{53} + 4896\sqrt{53} - 177120$. Simplifying this, we get $-146004 + 6536\sqrt{53}$. Expanding the denominator, we get $(612 + 80\sqrt{53})(612 - 80\sqrt{53}) = 612^2 - (80\sqrt{53})^2$. Simplifying this, we get $376384 - 320(53)$. Combining like terms, we get $376384 - 16960$. Simplifying this, we get $359824$. Therefore, the expression becomes $\frac{-146004 + 6536\sqrt{53}}{359824}$. Now, we can simplify the fraction: $\frac{-146004 + 6536\sqrt{53}}{359824} = \frac{-146004}{359824} + \frac{6536\sqrt{53}}{359824}$. Simplifying the first fraction, we get $\frac{-146004}{359824} = \frac{-36151}{89904}$. Now, we can simplify the second fraction: $\frac{6536\sqrt{53}}{359824} = \frac{1634\sqrt{53}}{89904}$. Therefore, the expression becomes $\frac{-36151}{89904} + \frac{1634\sqrt{53}}{89904}$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is $89904$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as $\frac{-36151(1)}{89904} + \frac{1634\sqrt{53}(1)}{89904}$. Combining the fractions, we get $\frac{-36151 + 1634\sqrt{53}}{89904}$. Therefore, the final answer is $\frac{-36151 + 1634\sqrt{53}}{89904}$.</answer>"

If $f$ is a function and $f^{-1}$ is its inverse, then $f^{-1}(y)$ gives the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = y$. In other words, $f^{-1}(y)$ is the value that $x$ takes when $f(x) = y$. We are given that $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 6$, and $f(3) = 5$. We can use this information to find the inverse function $f^{-1}$. We can create a table of values for $f^{-1}$ as follows:

| $y$ | $x$ |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | 1 |
| 5 | 3 |
| 6 | 2 |

From this table, we can see that $f^{-1}(2) = 1$, $f^{-1}(5) = 3$, and $f^{-1}(6) = 2$. Now, we need to find $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$. Since $f^{-1}(6) = 2$, we have $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = f^{-1}(2)$. From the table, we can see that $f^{-1}(2) = 1$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = 1$.</think><answer>1</answer>"

We know that the average of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 2. So, the average of $a$ and $2b$ being 7 gives us the equation $\frac{a+2b}{2} = 7$, and the average of $a$ and $2c$ being 8 gives us the equation $\frac{a+2c}{2} = 8$. We can simplify these equations to $a+2b = 14$ and $a+2c = 16$. Now, we want to find the average of $a$, $b$, and $c$, which is $\frac{a+b+c}{3}$. To find this, we can first solve for $a$ in the first equation, $a = 14 - 2b$, and substitute this into the second equation to get $14 - 2b + 2c = 16$. This simplifies to $2c - 2b = 2$. We can divide this by 2 to get $c - b = 1$. Now, we need another equation involving just $b$ and $c$. We can solve for $a$ in the second equation, $a = 16 - 2c$, and substitute this into the first equation to get $16 - 2c + 2b = 14$, which simplifies to $2b - 2c = -2$. Dividing this by 2, we get $b - c = -1$. Now we have two equations, $c - b = 1$ and $b - c = -1$. Adding these two equations together, we get $0 = 0$, which doesn't give us any new information. However, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get $2b - (-b) = 2$, which simplifies to $3b = 2$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = \frac{2}{3}$. Now that we have $b$, we can substitute it into one of our original equations to solve for $c$. Let's use $c - b = 1$, so we have $c - \frac{2}{3} = 1$, which simplifies to $c = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}$. Finally, we can substitute $b$ and $c$ into the equation $a+2b = 14$ to solve for $a$. We have $a + 2(\frac{2}{3}) = 14$, which simplifies to $a = 14 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{38}{3}$. Now that we have $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can find the average of the three numbers. The average is $\frac{\frac{38}{3} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3}}{3} = \frac{\frac{45}{3}}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5$.</think><answer> 5 </answer>"

We are given that the sum of the original series is 2000, so we can write $\frac{a}{1 - r} = 2000$. We are also given that the sum of the new series, obtained by squaring each term of the original series, is 16 times the sum of the original series. The sum of this new series can be expressed as $\frac{a^2}{1 - r^2}$. Since this sum is 16 times the sum of the original series, we can write $\frac{a^2}{1 - r^2} = 16 \times 2000$. We can simplify this equation to $\frac{a^2}{1 - r^2} = 32000$. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for $a$ in terms of $r$ using the first equation, and then substitute this expression into the second equation. Substituting $\frac{a}{1 - r} = 2000$ into $\frac{a^2}{1 - r^2} = 32000$, we get $\frac{(1 - r)(2000)^2}{(1 - r)^2} = 32000$. We can simplify this equation to $2000^2 = 32000$. However, this does not make sense, as the left-hand side is a constant, while the right-hand side is an equation. This means that we need to re-examine our equations. Let's go back to the first equation and try to solve for $a$ in terms of $r$. We have $\frac{a}{1 - r} = 2000$. Multiplying both sides by $(1 - r)$, we get $a = 2000(1 - r)$. Now we can substitute this expression for $a$ into the second equation. Substituting $a = 2000(1 - r)$ into $\frac{a^2}{1 - r^2} = 32000$, we get $\frac{(2000(1 - r))^2}{1 - r^2} = 32000$. We can simplify this equation to $\frac{2000^2(1 - r)^2}{1 - r^2} = 32000$. We can cancel out the $2000^2$ term, as it is present on both the numerator and denominator, leaving us with $\frac{(1 - r)^2}{1 - r^2} = \frac{16}{25}$. We can cross-multiply to get $25(1 - r)^2 = 16(1 - r^2)$. Expanding the squares, we get $25(1 - 2r + r^2) = 16(1 - r^2)$. Expanding the parentheses, we get $25 - 50r + 25r^2 = 16 - 16r^2$. We can combine like terms to get $41r^2 - 50r + 9 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $r$. We can solve for $r$ using the quadratic formula, $r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 41$, $b = -50$, and $c = 9$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $r = \frac{50 \pm \sqrt{(-50)^2 - 4(41)(9)}}{2(41)}$. Simplifying, we get $r = \frac{50 \pm \sqrt{2500 - 1464}}{82}$. Further simplifying, we get $r = \frac{50 \pm \sqrt{1036}}{82}$. We can simplify the square root to get $r = \frac{50 \pm 32.25}{82}$. We have two possible values for $r$: $r = \frac{50 + 32.25}{82}$ and $r = \frac{50 - 32.25}{82}$. Evaluating the first expression, we get $r = \frac{82.25}{82}$. Evaluating the second expression, we get $r = \frac{17.75}{82}$. We can simplify both expressions to get $r = 1.0025$ and $r = 0.215$. However, $r$ cannot be equal to 1, as this would result in a sum of 0 for the original series. Therefore, we can discard this value of $r$. Now we can find the value of $m$ and $n$. We have $r = \frac{17.75}{82}$. We can simplify this expression to get $r = \frac{7.5}{41}$. Therefore, $m = 7.5$ and $n = 41$. However, $m$ and $n$ must be relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, we can multiply both $m$ and $n$ by 2 to get $m = 15$ and $n = 82$. Now we can find $m + n$. We have $m = 15$ and $n = 82$. Therefore, $m + n = 97$. </think><answer> 97 </answer>"
