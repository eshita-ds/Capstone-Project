      "Alright, so I need to figure out how many vertical asymptotes are in the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\). Hmm, okay. Let me recall what a vertical asymptote is. If you remember correctly, it's where the function approaches infinity or negative infinity as \\( x \\) gets closer and closer to some value from either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for rational functions like this one, which can be written as \\( \\frac{\\text{polynomial}}{\\text{another polynomial}} \\), vertical asymptotes occur at the zeros of the denominator (where the denominator equals zero but the numerator doesn't; otherwise, there might just be an indeterminate form like \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\)).\n",

      "Wait, let me make sure that understanding is correct because sometimes if both numerator and denominator become zero when plugging into the limit, we might get something else called an \"indeterminate\" form, maybe even a hole instead of an asymptote. But in our case, since only the denominator becomes zero, while the numerator remains non-zero, then yes, those points will indeed lead us to vertical asymptotes.\n",

      "Okay, moving on. So first step: solve \\( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\). To find its roots, perhaps factoring?\n",
      "\n",

      " The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes. Hence the answer to this question is $2$.\n",

      "Rearranging the second equation, we have that $b^3=\\frac{4}{27}a$. If we substitute this into the original equation, we get $\\frac{4}{27}a^3=\\frac{32}{27}$; after multiplying each side by $\\frac{27}{4}$ and taking the cube root, we see that $a=2$. Substituting $a$ into the first equation, we get that $b^3=\\frac{8}{27}$ or $b=\\frac23$. Thus, $a+b=2+\\frac23=\\boxed{\\frac83}$. Hence the answer to this question is $83$.\n",
