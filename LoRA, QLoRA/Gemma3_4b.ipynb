If any factors in the numerator are also factors of the denominator, they can be cancelled out so that there is no longer an asymptote at those values of $x$. Then count the number of remaining factors in the denominator to determine the number of vertical asymptotes.\n",

Since neither appears, then it has exactly two vertical asymptotes.</think>The expression for which I'm looking for the number of vertical asymptotes simplifies to: $y=\\frac{2}{(x-2)(x+3)}$. The only way to cancel out terms from both the numerator and denominator would require me to multiply by some value such that $(x-2)\\cdot(x+3)=1$, but since that cannot happen, my original equation remains unchanged when simplifying.

We can rewrite both equations as exponential expressions with a common base if we want. Let's try writing them as logarithms so they have similar forms.\n",
      "</think>SOLUTION\n",
      "Given that $a^2 b^3 = \\frac{32}{27}$ and $\\frac{a}{b^3} = \\frac{27}{4}$.  We write these equations as logarithmic expressions by taking the logarithm (base any number) on each side:\n",
      "\\[\\log(a^2)+\\log(b^3)=\\log(\\frac{32}{27})\\]and\n",
      "\\[\\log(a)-\\log(b^3)=3\\log(\\frac{27}{4}). \\]Since $\\log x+\\log y = \\log xy$, then $\\log(a^2 b^3)=\\log (\\frac{32}{27})$. Then $a^2 b^3 = \\frac{32}{27}$. Also since $\\log x-\\log y = \\log \\left( \\frac{x}{y}\\right)$, then $\\log(\\frac{a}{b^3})=\\log(\\frac{27}{4})$, which implies that $$\\frac{a}{b^3}= \\frac{27}{4}.$$This means $a= \\frac{27}{4} b^3$. Substituting into $a^2 b^3 = \\frac{32}{27}$, we get $(\\frac{27}{4})^2 b^3 = \\frac{32}{27}$, i.e., $\\frac{729}{16} b^3 = \\frac{32}{27}$. Therefore, $$b^3 = \\frac{\\frac{32}{27}}{\\frac{729}{16}} = \\frac{32}{27} \\cdot \\frac{16}{729} = \\frac{512}{19683}$$so $$b = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{512}{19683}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt[3]{19683}}$$However, there must be an easier way to solve it than this\n",
      "\n",
      "Reference Answer:\n",
      "Rearranging the second equation, we have that $b^3=\\frac{4}{27}a$. If we substitute this into the original equation, we get $\\frac{4}{27}a^3=\\frac{32}{27}$; after multiplying each side by $\\frac{27}{4}$ and taking the cube root, we see that $a=2$. Substituting $a$ into the first equation, we get that $b^3=\\frac{8}{27}$ or $b=\\frac23$. Thus, $a+b=2+\\frac23=\\boxed{\\frac83}$. Hence the answer to this question is $83$.\n",
